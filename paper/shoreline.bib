  abstract = {Most discussion of habitable planets has focused on Earth-like planets with globally abundant liquid water. For an "aqua planet" like Earth, the surface freezes if far from its sun, and the water vapor greenhouse effect runs away if too close. Here we show that "land planets" (desert worlds with limited surface water) have wider habitable zones than aqua planets. For planets at the inner edge of the habitable zone, a land planet has two advantages over an aqua planet: (i) the tropics can emit longwave radiation at rates above the traditional runaway limit because the air is unsaturated and (ii) the dry air creates a dry stratosphere that limits hydrogen escape. At the outer limits of the habitable zone, the land planet better resists global freezing because there is less water for clouds, snow, and ice. Here we describe a series of numerical experiments using a simple three-dimensional global climate model for Earth-sized planets. Other things (CO\textsubscript{2}, rotation rate, surface pressure) unchanged, we found that liquid water remains stable at the poles of a low-obliquity land planet until net insolation exceeds 415 W/m\textsuperscript{2} (170\% that of modern Earth), compared to 330 W/m\textsuperscript{2} (135\%) for the aqua planet. At the outer limits, we found that a low-obliquity land planet freezes at 77\%, while the aqua planet freezes at 90\%. High-obliquity land and aqua planets freeze at 58\% and 72\%, respectively, with the poles offering the last refuge. We show that it is possible that, as the Sun brightens, an aqua planet like Earth can lose most of its hydrogen and become a land planet without first passing through a sterilizing runaway greenhouse. It is possible that Venus was a habitable land planet as recently as 1 billion years ago.},

  abstract = {The earliest surface environment of the Earth is reconstructed in accordance with the planetary formation theory. Formation of an atmosphere is an inevitable consequence of Earth's formation. The atmosphere near the close of accretion is composed of 200 {$\sim$} 300 bars of H \textsubscript{2} and H \textsubscript{2}O, and several tens of bars of CO and CO \textsubscript{2}. Either by the blanketing effect of the proto-atmosphere or heating by large planetesimal impacts a magma ocean is formed during accretion. We can distinguish three stages for the thermal evolution of the magma ocean and proto-crust. Stage 0 is characterized by a super-liquidus (or completely molten) regime near the surface. At this stage the surface of the Earth is covered by a super-liquidus magma ocean. No chemical differentiation is expected during this stage. Once the energy flux released by planet formation decreases to the 200 W/m \textsuperscript{2} level the super-liquidus magma ocean then disappears within a time interval of 1 m.y. This is the transition from stage 0 to 1. Stage 1 is characterized by a partially molten magma ocean. In the magma ocean consisting of 20 {$\sim$} 30\% partial melt, heat transport is controlled by melt-solid separation (a type of compositional convection) rather than thermal convection. Chemical differentiation of the mantle mainly occurs in this stage. Once the energy flux drops to the 160 W/m \textsuperscript{2} level, more than 90\% of water vapor in the proto-atmosphere condense to form the proto-oceans. Several tens of bars of CO and CO \textsubscript{2} remain in the atmosphere just after formation of the oceans. Water oceans are occasionally evaporated by large impacts. After each such event, recondensation of the ocean takes several hundred years. Although the surface is covered by a chilled proto-crust, it is short-lived because of extensive volcanic resurfacing activity as well as meteorite impacts resurfacing. This stage ends when the energy flux drops to 0.1 {$\sim$} 1 W/m \textsuperscript{2} level. The duration time of stage 1 is estimated to be several hundred million years (the best estimate is about 400 m.y.). Stage 2 is characterized by solid state convection. This stage continues to the present day. One of the most important change on the proto-Earth is the transition from stage 1 to 2, which occurs several hundred million years after the Earth formation. Long-lived crust is formed only after this transition.},

  abstract = {We have collected transit times for the TRAPPIST-1 system with the Spitzer Space Telescope over four years. We add to these ground-based, HST, and K2 transit-time measurements, and revisit an N-body dynamical analysis of the seven-planet system using our complete set of times from which we refine the mass ratios of the planets to the star. We next carry out a photodynamical analysis of the Spitzer light curves to derive the density of the host star and the planet densities. We find that all seven planets' densities may be described with a single rocky mass-radius relation which is depleted in iron relative to Earth, with Fe 21 wt\% versus 32 wt\% for Earth, and otherwise Earth-like in composition. Alternatively, the planets may have an Earth-like composition but enhanced in light elements, such as a surface water layer or a core-free structure with oxidized iron in the mantle. We measure planet masses to a precision of 3\%-5\%, equivalent to a radial-velocity (RV) precision of 2.5 cm s-1, or two orders of magnitude more precise than current RV capabilities. We find the eccentricities of the planets are very small, the orbits are extremely coplanar, and the system is stable on 10 Myr timescales. We find evidence of infrequent timing outliers, which we cannot explain with an eighth planet; we instead account for the outliers using a robust likelihood function. We forecast JWST timing observations and speculate on possible implications of the planet densities for the formation, migration, and evolution of the planet system.},

Producing reductions using the ExoTiC-JEDI and Eureka! pipelines, we obtain a median transit depth precision of 34 ppm for both visits and both reductions in spectroscopic channels 30 pixels wide ({$\sim$}0.02 {$\mu$}m). We find that our independent reductions produce consistent transmission spectra; however, each visit shows differing overall structure. For both reductions, a flat line is preferred for Visit 1 while a flat line with an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors is preferred for Visit 2; however, we are able to correct for this offset during our modeling analysis following methods outlined in previous works. Using PICASO forward models, we can rule out metallicities up to at least 100{\texttimes} solar with an opaque pressure of 10\textsuperscript{-3} bars to {$\geq$}3{$\sigma$} in all cases; however, the exact lower limit varies between the visits, with Visit 1 ruling out {$\lessequivlnt$}100{\texttimes} solar while the lower limits for Visit 2 extend beyond {$\sim$}350{\texttimes} solar. Our results add to the growing list of super-Earth atmospheric constraints by JWST, which provide critical insight into the diversity and challenges of characterizing terrestrial planets.},

  abstract = {Context. M-dwarf systems offer an opportunity to study terrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres due to their small size and cool temperatures. However, the extreme conditions imposed by these host stars raise a question about whether their close-in rocky planets are able to retain any atmosphere at all. Aims. The Hot Rocks Survey aims to answer this question by targeting nine different M-dwarf rocky planets spanning a range of planetary and stellar properties. Of these, LHS 1478 b orbits an M3-type star, has an equilibrium temperature of Teq = 585 K, and receives 21 times Earth's instellation. Methods. We observed two secondary eclipses of LHS 1478 b using photometric imaging at 15 {\textmu}m using the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST MIRI) to measure thermal emission from the dayside of the planet. We compared these values to atmospheric models to evaluate potential heat transport and CO2 absorption signatures. Results. We find that a secondary eclipse depth of 138 {\textpm} 53 ppm at the expected time for a circular orbit is preferred over a null model at 2.8{$\sigma$}, a moderate detection, though dynamical models do favour a non-eccentric orbit for this planet. The second observation results in a non-detection due to significantly larger unexplained systematics. Based on the first observation alone, we can reject the null hypothesis of the dark (zero Bond albedo) no atmosphere bare rock model with a confidence level of 3.3{$\sigma$}, though for AB = 0.2 the significance decreases to 2.1{$\sigma$}. The tentative secondary eclipse depth is consistent with the majority of the atmospheric scenarios we considered, spanning CO2-rich atmospheres with surface pressures from 0.1 to 10 bar. However, we stress that the two observations from our programme do not yield consistent results, and more observations are needed to verify our findings. The Hot Rocks Survey serves as a relevant primer for future endeavours such as the Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) Rocky Worlds programme.},

L 98-59 is a nearby (10.6 pc), bright (H = 7.4 mag) M3V star that harbors three small, transiting planets. As one of the closest known transiting multi-planet systems, L 98-59 offers one of the best opportunities to probe and compare the atmospheres of rocky planets that formed in the same stellar environment. We measured the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 c, and the extracted spectrum showed marginal evidence (2.1{$\sigma$}) for wavelength-dependent transit depth variations that could indicate the presence of an atmosphere. We forward-modeled possible atmospheric compositions of the planet based on the transmission spectrum. Although L 98-59 was previously thought to be a fairly quiet star, we have seen evidence for stellar activity, and therefore we assessed a scenario where the source of the signal originates with inhomogeneities on the stellar surface. We also see a correlation between transits of L 98-59 c and L 98-59 b collected 12.5 hr apart, which is suggestive (but at \&lt;2{$\sigma$} confidence) of a contaminating component from the star impacting the exoplanet spectrum. While intriguing, our results are inconclusive and additional data are needed to verify any atmospheric signal. Fortunately, additional data have been collected from both the HST and James Webb Space Telescope. Should this result be confirmed with additional data, L 98-59 c would be the first planet smaller than 2 Earth radii with a detected atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Traditionally stellar radiation has been the only heat source considered capable of determining global climate on long timescales. Here we show that terrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high enough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long enough duration for all the hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and cannot support life. We call these planets "Tidal Venuses," and the phenomenon a "tidal greenhouse." Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases tidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its accompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle into nearly circular orbits (i.e. with negligible tidal heating) in the habitable zone (HZ). However, these planets are not habitable as past tidal heating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed follow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. Planets orbiting stars with masses \&lt;0.3 solar masses may be in danger of desiccation via tidal heating. We apply these concepts to Gl 667C c, a {\textasciitilde}4.5 Earth-mass planet orbiting a 0.3 solar mass star at 0.12 AU. We find that it probably did not lose its water via tidal heating as orbital stability is unlikely for the high eccentricities required for the tidal greenhouse. As the inner edge of the HZ is defined by the onset of a runaway or moist greenhouse powered by radiation, our results represent a fundamental revision to the HZ for non-circular orbits. In the appendices we review a) the moist and runaway greenhouses, b) hydrogen escape, c) stellar mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations, d) terrestrial planet mass-radius relations, and e) linear tidal theories.

  abstract = {NASA's Kepler Mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. The mission reached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rocky planet, Kepler-10b. Two distinct sets of transit events were detected: (1) a 152 {\textpm} 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 {\textpm} 0.024 hr with ephemeris T [BJD] =2454964.57375+0.00060 -0.00082 + N*0.837495+0.000004 -0.000005 days and (2) a 376 {\textpm} 9 ppm dimming lasting 6.86 {\textpm} 0.07 hr with ephemeris T [BJD] =2454971.6761+0.0020 -0.0023 + N*45.29485+0.00065 -0.00076 days. Statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established the viability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-up observations. Forty precision Doppler measurements were used to confirm that the short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. The parent star is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. Photometry was collected at 1 minute cadence for {$>$}4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsation frequencies. Modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of the fundamental stellar properties. Kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 {\textpm} 4.5 Gyr) but otherwise Sun-like main-sequence star with T eff = 5627 {\textpm} 44 K, M sstarf = 0.895 {\textpm} 0.060 M sun, and R sstarf = 1.056 {\textpm} 0.021 R sun. Physical models simultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision Doppler measurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of Kepler-10b that speak to its rocky composition: M P = 4.56+1.17 -1.29 M {$\oplus$}, R P = 1.416+0.033 -0.036 R {$\oplus$}, and {$\rho$}P = 8.8+2.1 -2.9 g cm-3. Kepler-10b is the smallest transiting exoplanet discovered to date. Based in part on observations obtained at the W. M.

  abstract = {The search for habitable exoplanets and life beyond the solar system is one of the most compelling scientific opportunities of our time. Nevertheless, the high cost of building facilities that can address this topic and the keen public interest in the results of such research requires rigorous development of experiments that can deliver a definitive advancement in our understanding. Most work to date in this area has focused on a ``systems science'' approach of obtaining and interpreting comprehensive data for individual planets to make statements about their habitability and the possibility that they harbor life. This strategy is challenging because of the diversity of exoplanets, both observed and expected, and the limited information that can be obtained with astronomical instruments. Here, we propose a complementary approach that is based on performing surveys of key planetary characteristics and using statistical marginalization to answer broader questions than can be addressed with a small sample of objects. The fundamental principle of this comparative planetology approach is maximizing what can be learned from each type of measurement by applying it widely rather than requiring that multiple kinds of observations be brought to bear on a single object. As a proof of concept, we outline a survey of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric water and carbon dioxide abundances that would test the habitable zone hypothesis and lead to a deeper understanding of the frequency of habitable planets. We also discuss ideas for additional surveys that could be developed to test other foundational hypotheses in this area.},

  abstract = {Assessing the prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets around M-dwarf stars is a top priority of exoplanet science. High-energy activity from M dwarfs can destroy the atmospheres of these planets, which could explain the lack of atmosphere detections to date. Volcanic outgassing has been proposed as a mechanism to replenish the atmospheres of tidally heated rocky planets. L 98-59 b, a sub-Earth transiting a nearby M dwarf, was recently identified as the most promising exoplanet to detect a volcanic atmosphere. We present the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 b from four transits observed with JWST NIRSpec G395H. Although the airless model provides an adequate fit to the data based on its {$\chi$}2, an SO2 atmosphere is preferred by 3.6{$\sigma$} over a flat line in terms of the Bayesian evidence. Such an atmosphere would likely be in a steady state where volcanism balances escape. If so, L 98-59 b must experience at least eight times as much volcanism and tidal heating per unit mass as Io. If volcanism is driven by runaway melting of the mantle, we predict the existence of a subsurface magma ocean in L 98-59 b extending up to Rp {$\sim$} 60\%--90\%. An SO2-rich volcanic atmosphere on L 98-59 b would be indicative of an oxidized mantle with an oxygen fugacity of fO2 {$>$} IW + 2.7, and it would imply that L 98-59 b must have retained some of its volatile endowment despite its proximity to its star. Our findings suggest that volcanism may revive secondary atmospheres on tidally heated rocky planets around M dwarfs.},

We use Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 transmission spectroscopy with the G280 and G141 grisms to study the spectrum of LTT 1445Ab between 0.2 and 1.65 {$\mu$}m. In doing so, we uncover an ultraviolet (UV) flare on the neighboring star LTT 1445C that is completely invisible at optical wavelengths; we report one of the first simultaneous near-UV/optical spectra of an M dwarf flare. The planet spectrum is consistent with a flat line (with median transit depth uncertainties of 128 and 52 ppm for the G280 and G141 observations, respectively), though the infrared (IR) portion displays potential features that could be explained by known opacity sources such as HCN. Some atmospheric retrievals weakly favor ({$\sim$}2{$\sigma$}) an atmosphere, but it remains challenging to discern between stellar contamination, an atmosphere, and a featureless spectrum at this time. We do, however, confidently rule out {$\leq$}100{\texttimes} solar metallicity atmospheres. Although stellar contamination retrievals cannot fit the IR features well, the overall spectrum is consistent with stellar contamination from hot or cold spots. Based on the UV/optical data, we place limits on the extent of stellar variability expected in the near-IR (30--40 ppm), which will be critical for future James Webb Space Telescope observations.},

  abstract = {Kuiper Belt Objects are thought to be remnants of early solar system materials, which have retained volatiles such as CH\textsubscript{4} and C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6}. Spectroscopic data from various sources reveals that while Pluto retains CH\textsubscript{4} and C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6}, Sedna shows a lack of CH\textsubscript{4} but an abundance of C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6} (Emery et al. 2024). We hypothesized that CH\textsubscript{4}, while stable on Pluto, is able to escape from less massive Sedna sufficiently rapidly to be depleted over the age of the solar system, while C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6} has been retained due to its larger molecular mass. Utilizing models for Jeans escape and hydrodynamic escape, as appropriate for a given mass of object and of escaping species, we analyzed the stability and escape rates of CH\textsubscript{4} and C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6} on both Pluto and Sedna. We explored a wide range of masses of Sedna, ranging from {$\frac{1}{2}$} to {$\frac{1}{10}$} the mass of Pluto, and three different abundances of CH\textsubscript{4} and C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6} using measured values from Comet 67-P, and Enceladus, and an upper limit assuming clathrate hydrate. We find that CH\textsubscript{4} remains stable on Pluto, but escapes from Sedna due to its lower mass, whereas C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6} remains stable when using both 100 \% and 10 \% outgassing rates. This result is in agreement with the observed spectra and leads to a tighter mass constraint for Sedna. Our model also explains the observed absence of methane on another KBO, Gonggong.},

We present results from a study designed to evaluate the feasibility of using precise near-infrared (NIR) photometry to detect terrestrial extrasolar planets orbiting UCDs. We used the Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL) to observe a sample of 13 UCDs over a period of 10 months. We consider several important systematic effects in NIR differential photometry and develop techniques for generating photometry with a precision of 0.01 mag and long-term stability. We simulate the planet detection efficiency of an extended campaign to monitor a large sample of UCDs with PAIRITEL. We find that both a targeted campaign with a single telescope lasting several years and a campaign making use of a network of telescopes distributed in longitude could provide significant sensitivity to terrestrial planets orbiting UCDs, potentially in the habitable zone.},

  abstract = {Astronomers have discovered a handful of exoplanets with rocky bulk compositions but orbiting that orbit so close to their host star that the surface of the planet must be at least partially molten. It is expected that the dayside of such "lava planets" harbors a rock-vapor atmosphere that flows quickly toward the airless nightside-this partial atmosphere is critical to the interpretation of lava planet observations, but transports negligible heat toward the nightside. As a result, the surface temperature of the magma ocean may range from 3000 K near the substellar point down to 1500 K near the day-night terminator. We use simple models incorporating the thermodynamics and geochemistry of partial melt to predict the physical and chemical properties of the magma ocean as a function of the distance from the substellar point. Our principal findings are that: (1) the dayside magma ocean is much deeper than previously thought, probably extending down to the core-mantle boundary below the substellar point of an Earth-sized planet; (2) much of the dayside is only partially molten, leading to gradients in the surface chemistry of the magma ocean; and (3) the temperature at the base of the silicate mantle is as important as the surface temperature. In the most extreme cases, lava planet interiors could be cold enough such that thermal stratification below the substellar point is gravitationally stable. These findings have important implications for the dynamics of the magma ocean, as well as the composition and dynamics of the atmosphere.},

Observations from Gemini Observatory show that the infrared spectrum is, like that of Pluto and 2005 FY9, dominated by the presence of frozen methane, although visible photometry shows that the object is almost neutral in color compared to Pluto's extremely red color. 2003 UB313 is likely to undergo substantial seasonal change over the large range of heliocentric distances that it travels; at its current distance, Pluto is likely to prove a useful analog for better understanding the range of seasonal changes on this body.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The radius valley (or gap) in the observed distribution of exoplanet radii, which separates smaller super-Earths from larger sub-Neptunes, is a key feature that theoretical models must explain. Conventionally, it is interpreted as the result of the loss of primordial hydrogen and helium (H/He) envelopes atop rocky cores. However, planet formation models predict that water-rich planets migrate from cold regions outside the snowline towards the star. Assuming water to be in the form of solid ice in their interior, many of these planets would be located in the radius gap contradicting observations. Here we use an advanced coupled formation and evolution model that describes the planets' growth and evolution starting from solid, moon-sized bodies in the protoplanetary disk to mature Gyr-old planetary systems. Employing new equations of state and interior structure models to treat water as vapour mixed with H/He, we naturally reproduce the valley at the observed location. The model results demonstrate that the observed radius valley can be interpreted as the separation of less massive, rocky super-Earths formed in situ from more massive, ex situ, water-rich sub-Neptunes. Furthermore, the occurrence drop at larger radii, the so-called radius cliff, is matched by planets with water-dominated envelopes. Our statistical approach shows that the synthetic distribution of radii quantitatively agrees with observations for close-in planets, but only if low-mass planets initially containing H/He lose their atmosphere due to photoevaporation, which populates the super-Earth peak with evaporated rocky cores. Therefore, we provide a hybrid theoretical explanation of the radius gap and cliff caused by both planet formation (orbital migration) as well as evolution (atmospheric escape).},

At 1.730 {\textpm} 0.025 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}, LHS 1140 b falls within the radius valley separating H\textsubscript{2}-rich mini-Neptunes from rocky super-Earths. Recent mass and radius revisions indicate a bulk density significantly lower than expected for an Earth-like rocky interior, suggesting that LHS 1140 b could be either a mini-Neptune with a small envelope of hydrogen ({$\sim$}0.1\% by mass) or a water world (9\%--19\% water by mass). Atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy can readily discern between these two scenarios. Here we present two JWST/NIRISS transit observations of LHS 1140 b, one of which captures a serendipitous transit of LHS 1140 c. The combined transmission spectrum of LHS 1140 b shows a telltale spectral signature of unocculted faculae (5.8{$\sigma$}), covering {$\sim$}20\% of the visible stellar surface. Besides faculae, our spectral retrieval analysis reveals tentative evidence of residual spectral features, best fit by Rayleigh scattering from a N\textsubscript{2}-dominated atmosphere (2.3{$\sigma$}), irrespective of the consideration of atmospheric hazes. We also show through Global Climate Models (GCMs) that H\textsubscript{2}-rich atmospheres of various compositions (100{\texttimes}, 300{\texttimes}, 1000{\texttimes} solar metallicity) are ruled out to \&gt;10{$\sigma$}. The GCM calculations predict that water clouds form below the transit photosphere, limiting their impact on transmission data. Our observations suggest that LHS 1140 b is either airless or, more likely, surrounded by an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight. Our tentative evidence of a N\textsubscript{2}-rich atmosphere provides strong motivation for future transmission spectroscopy observations of LHS 1140 b.},

  abstract = {Aims. We investigate the impact of CO2 on the distribution of water on TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g during the magma ocean stage. These potentially habitable rocky planets are currently the most accessible for astronomical observations. A constraint on the volatile budget during the magma ocean stage is a key link to planet formation and also to judging their habitability. Methods. We expanded the MagmOc module of the VPLanet environment to perform simulations with 1-100 terrestrial oceans (TOs) of H2O with and without CO2 and for albedos 0 and 0.75. The CO2 mass was scaled with initial H2O by a constant factor between 0.1 and 1. Results. The magma ocean state of rocky planets begins with a CO2-dominated atmosphere but can evolve into a H2O dominated state, depending on initial conditions. For less than 10 TO initial H2O, the atmosphere tends to desiccate and the evolution can end with a CO2 dominated atmosphere. Otherwise, the final state is a thick ({$>$}1000 bar) H2O-CO2 atmosphere. Complete atmosphere desiccation with less than 10 TO initial H2O can be significantly delayed for TRAPPIST-1 e and f, when H2O has to diffuse through a CO2 atmosphere to reach the upper atmosphere, where photolysis due to extreme ultra violet irradiation occurs. As a consequence of CO2 diffusion-limited water loss, the time of mantle solidification for TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g can be significantly extended compared to a pure H2O evolution by up to 40 Myrs for an albedo of 0.75 and by up to 200 Mys for an albedo of 0. The addition of CO2 further results in a higher water content in the melt during the magma ocean stage. Thus, more water can be sequestered in the solid mantle. However, only up to 6\% of the initial water mass can be stored in the mantle at the end of the magma ocean stage. Our compositional model adjusted for the measured metallicity of TRAPPIST-1 yields for the dry inner planets (b, c, d) an iron fraction of 27 wt\%. For TRAPPIST-1 e, this iron fraction would be compatible with a (partially) desiccated evolution scenario and a CO2 atmosphere with surface pressures of a few 100 bar. Conclusions. A comparative study between TRAPPIST-1 e and the inner planets may yield the most insights about formation and evolution scenarios by confronting, respectively, a scenario with a desiccated evolution due to volatile-poor formation and a volatile-rich scenario with extended atmospheric erosion.},

  abstract = {Mars has lost a large fraction of its water to space, with the H component of this loss thought to occur mainly as a result of thermal (Jeans) escape from the upper atmosphere. Constraints on H loss have historically been made using hydrogen Lyman alpha (121.6 nm) light scattered in the planet's extended upper atmosphere or corona. Here we employ observations from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) to constrain H escape in December 2014 and August 2016, when MAVEN observed the dayside corona at low latitude. To obtain adequate fits and address systematic sources of uncertainty including instrument calibration, we fit in exobase number density and escape rate instead of density and temperature, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. This produces better model fits to data than most previous analyses. When we assume a single population of H atoms, we obtain H temperatures inconsistent with expected trends and a shape mismatch between observed and modeled profiles, similar to previous studies. Introducing either a second population of H (at a distinct temperature and density) or adding deuterium to the corona allows for essentially perfect fits. Despite this model ambiguity, derived loss rates for both periods are within a factor of four, 3.3-8.8{\texttimes}108cm-2/s in December 2014 (Ls{$\sim$}250) and 0.6-2.3{\texttimes}108cm-2/s in August 2016 (Ls{$\sim$}200). These rates are similar to those found in prior studies and confirm the known seasonal trend---doing so while incorporating the substantial uncertainty in absolute calibration insufficiently explored by previous studies.},

  abstract = {Mars has lost most of its initial water to space as atomic hydrogen and oxygen. Spacecraft measurements have determined that present-day hydrogen escape undergoes large variations with season that are inconsistent with long-standing explanations. The cause is incompletely understood, with likely contributions from seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation, dust activity and solar extreme ultraviolet input. Although some modelling and indirect observational evidence suggest that dust activity can explain the seasonal trend, no previous study has been able to unambiguously distinguish seasonal from dust-driven forcing. Here we present synoptic measurements of dust, temperature, ice, water and hydrogen on Mars during a regional dust event, demonstrating that individual dust events can boost planetary H loss by a factor of five to ten. This regional storm occurred in the declining phase of the known seasonal trend, establishing that dust forcing can override this trend to drive enhanced escape. Because similar regional storms occur in most Mars years, these storms may be responsible for a large fraction of Martian water loss and represent an important driver of Mars atmospheric evolution.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive theory is presented for the region of a planetary atmosphere where collisions are rare and where the controlling factors are gravitational attraction and thermal energy conducted from below. Although the subject of this article originated literally with the kinetic theory itself, until recently attention has been confined to atmospheric evaporation. The early sections (1-4) are developed on the classic assumption of a sharply defined critical level, above which the atmosphere is completely free of collisions. Throughout, the different types of particle orbits are treated separately; coronal particles are either ballistic (meaning captive particles whose orbits intersect the critical level), satellite (captive particles orbiting above the critical level), or escaping. Liouville's equation leads to exact expressions for the density distributions and escape flux. The latter is a simple analytic expression, but the density integrals are more complex and numerical evaluations have been provided in tables. At large distances from the planet all the integrals may be evaluated in their asymptotic limits. Expressions are given for the different density components, the kinetic temperature, and heat flux. The latter two cannot generally be evaluated with the thermal conductivity as normally computed. The integrated density in a column above a specified height and orientated in a specified direction is given particular attention, because it fixes the critical level and because it is essentially an observable quantity. Numerical calculations are given for relating such observations in either the radial or transverse directions to the basic parameters of the corona (the criticallevel density, temperature, and height above the planet). The radial integrated density at the critical level is shown to deviate sensibly from the simple expression applicable to a planeparallel atmosphere unless the gravitational energy is very much greater than the mean thermal energy. Section 5 utilizes results of the preceding theory to justify the adoption in the first place of the concept of a critical level. The principal question focuses on the outward flux of escaping particles. A detailed treatment of escape as governed by collisions agrees with earlier similar analyses in showing that (with certain approximations) the critical-level concept predicts the accurate flux. However, it is noted that this result, except for confirming the height of the critical level, is trivial: it is a consequence of an assumed Maxwellian distribution and the special properties accruing to it. Section 6 treats a variety of related problems dealing with production and loss mechanisms, after some orbital properties and flight times are investigated. The critical-level theory cannot cope with the important question of the abundance of satellite orbits. Here it is shown that the satellite contribution may be included throughout the theory by omitting the expressions for the satellite component as such and evaluating the ballistic component, not with the critical level, but with a higher satellite critical level instead. For the Earth's hydrogen corona this level is near 2.5 Earth radii. The effect of photoionization on the density distribution of escaping orbits is also treated and shown to be negligible for the Earth. The concentration of hot interplanetary gas around a bare planet offers an interesting effect in that screening of orbits by the planet may more than counteract condensation due to the gravitational attraction. A hot, stationary interplanetary gas intermingled with a planetary corona will not have any appreciable effect on the coronal density or temperature distributions. Specifically, it is inappropriate to regard heat as being "conducted" (in the usual meaning of the word) from the interplanetary medium through the corona. Doppler profiles of coronal particles in a column along a specified direction have been examined in Section 7. Asymptotic expressions are given along with the general formulae, which will have to be evaluated numerically if and when the pertinent spectral observations are made. Even at large distances from the planet where the population consists largely of escaping particles, the shape of the spectral profile does not deviate very seriously in radially outward velocities from the profile with the Maxwellian distribution at the critical level. Section 8 examines the basic assumption of the entire preceding theory: the establishment of a Maxwellian distribution near the critical level. The collision treatment here is based on the Boltzmann equation, and while it is crude, it is not trivial. The conclusion is that the Maxwellian distribution in the upward direction is depleted beyond the escape velocity by several per cent, but this depletion is generally negligible when compared with errors produced by small uncertainties in temperature. The deviations would be important only were it possible to make measurements affected by the detailed shape of the velocity distribution curve. Real coronae are summarized briefly in Section 9. While more and better observations are needed, it appears now that the hydrogen geocorona may become seriously perturbed into a geocoma, as Brandt labelled it, by solar particles flowing past the Earth. Attention is also directed to observations of the helium geocorona as a means of clarifying the now highly confused "helium problem". Some estimates of the features of the Martian oxygen corona are made. Venus, as the Earth's sister planet, is an enigma, but coronal observations may point the way to an explanation of the distinctive differences between the evolution of the atmospheres of Venus and the Earth.},

  abstract = {Most of our knowledge of the earth's upper atmosphere is obtained from experiments in sit or remote observations that offer fairly direct interpretations. For the other planets, neither approach is as yet possible; so indirect, theoretical procedures are required to construct models of their atmospheres. Herein the wide variety of basic physical processes governing the structure of a planetary high atmosphere are set forth, with a view toward obtaining "deductive models' `-i e, models derived theoretically when only the chemical composition and temperature of the lower atmosphere and the incident solar flux are specified (in addition to various physical and astronomical constants). The procedures are applied to Mars, whose lower and middle atmosphere is already partially understood from earlier work, notably that of R. Goody. The uncertainties involved at various stages in the construction of such a model are emphasized, as are the major differences in physical processes and atmospheric characteristics between Mars and the earth. The most significant result is that the CO that must be in the upper atmosphere of Mars should serve as an effective thermostat, keeping the temperature at the escape level (1500 km) from exceeding about 11000 K. This is cool enough for Mars to retain atomic oxygen. Were it not for CO cooling, the upper atmosphere of Mars would be so extensive and form such an effective thermal insulation between the upper ionosphere and the heat sink at the mesopause that the temperature would exceed 20000 K. lifetime for the escape of oxygen is estimated as 10 years. The mesopause is determined by CO2 radiation. Near the mesopause CO2 should become dissociated and the free 0 atoms form a thin layer of O this effect has no analogy on earth. The model ionosphere has considerably smaller densities of ionization than comparable regions in the earth's atmosphere The E region is split into two distinct portions, with X-rays forming the higher one (E2) and ultraviolet light ionizing Oi near the mesopause (E1) The Martian analogue to the terrestrial F2 region may not develop a very high electron density, and the entire ionosphere should be depleted at night.},

  abstract = {Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of cool, rocky exoplanets reveal a probable lack of thick atmospheres, suggesting prevalent escape of the secondary atmospheres formed after losing primordial hydrogen. Yet, simulations indicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation (XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line cooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents a novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic framework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres, positioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial structure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law relationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our approach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates how ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially, hydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the atmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly with XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a collisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is determined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the star's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and revival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and Earth, LHS 1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b. Our modeling characterizes the bottleneck of atmospheric loss on the occurrence of observable Earth-like habitats and offers analytic tools for future studies.},

Here, we present a prescription to adapt the capabilities of the stellar evolution toolkit Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics to model sub-Neptune-mass planets with H/He envelopes. With the addition of routines treating the planet core luminosity, heavy-element enrichment, atmospheric boundary condition, and mass-loss due to hydrodynamic winds, the evolutionary pathways of planets with diverse starting conditions are more accurately constrained. Using these dynamical models, we construct mass-composition relationships of planets from 1-400 M {$\oplus$} and investigate how mass-loss impacts their composition and evolution history. We demonstrate that planet radii are typically insensitive to the evolution pathway that brought the planet to its instantaneous mass, composition and age, with variations from hysteresis {$\lessequivlnt$} 2 \% . We find that planet envelope mass-loss timescales, \{{$\tau$} \}\{env\}, vary non-monotonically with H/He envelope mass fractions (at fixed planet mass). In our simulations of young (100 Myr) low-mass (\{M\}\{\{p\}\}{$\lessequivlnt$} 10 \{M\}{\textbackslash}oplus ) planets with rocky cores, \{{$\tau$} \}\{env\} is maximized at \{M\}\{env\}/\{M\}\{\{p\}\}=1 \% to 3\%. The resulting convergent mass-loss evolution could potentially imprint itself on the close-in planet population as a preferred H/He mass fraction of {$\sim$} 1 \% . Looking ahead, we anticipate that this numerical code will see widespread applications complementing both 3D models and observational exoplanet surveys.},

This novel nonmonotonic behavior may arise from an intricate trade-off between the cross-sectional area of a planet (which increases with size, boosting escape rates) and its associated escape velocity (which also increases with size but diminishes escape rates). Our results could guide forthcoming observations because worlds with certain values of R (such as R {$\sim$} 0.7 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}) might exhibit comparatively higher escape rates when all other factors are constant.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the discovery of increasing numbers of rocky, terrestrial exoplanets orbiting nearby stars has drawn increased attention to the possibility of studying these planets' atmospheric and surface properties. This is especially true for planets orbiting M dwarfs, whose properties can best be studied with existing observatories. In particular, the minerological composition of these planets and the extent to which they can retain their atmospheres in the face of intense stellar irradiation both remain unresolved. Here, we report the detection of the secondary eclipse of the terrestrial exoplanet GJ 1252b, obtained via 10 eclipse observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC2 4.5 {$\mu$}m channel. We measure an eclipse depth of \$\{149\}\_\{-32\}{\textasciicircum}\{+25\}\$ ppm, corresponding to a dayside brightness temperature of \$\{1410\}\_\{-125\}{\textasciicircum}\{+91\}\$ K. This measurement is consistent with the prediction for a bare rock surface. Comparing the eclipse measurement to a large suite of simulated planetary spectra indicates that GJ 1252b has a surface pressure of {$\lessequivlnt$}10 bar, i.e., substantially thinner than the atmosphere of Venus. Assuming energy-limited escape, even a 100 bar atmosphere would be lost in \&lt;1 Myr, far shorter than our gyrochronological age estimate of 3.9 {\textpm} 0.4 Gyr. The expected mass loss could be overcome by mantle outgassing, but only if the mantle's carbon content were \&gt;7\% by mass-over two orders of magnitude greater than that found in Earth. We therefore conclude that GJ 1252b has no significant atmosphere. Model spectra with granitoid or feldspathic surface composition, but with no atmosphere, are disfavored at \&gt;2{$\sigma$}. The eclipse occurs just +1.4 \$\{\}\_\{-1.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+2.8\}\$ minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating \$e{\textbackslash}cos {\textbackslash}omega \$ = +0.0025 \$\{\}\_\{-0.0018\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0049\}\$ , consistent with a circular orbit. Tidal heating is therefore likely to be negligible with regard to GJ 1252b's global energy budget. Finally, we also analyze additional, unpublished TESS transit photometry of GJ 1252b, which improves the precision of the transit ephemeris by a factor of 10, provides a more precise planetary radius of 1.180 {\textpm} 0.078 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}, and rules out any transit-timing variations with amplitudes {$\greaterequivlnt$}1 minute.},

  abstract = {The potential habitability of known exoplanets is often categorized by a nominal equilibrium temperature assuming a Bond albedo of either {$\sim$}0.3, similar to Earth, or 0. As an indicator of habitability, this leaves much to be desired, because albedos of other planets can be very different, and because surface temperature exceeds equilibrium temperature due to the atmospheric greenhouse effect. We use an ensemble of general circulation model simulations to show that for a range of habitable planets, much of the variability of Bond albedo, equilibrium temperature and even surface temperature can be predicted with useful accuracy from incident stellar flux and stellar temperature, two known parameters for every confirmed exoplanet. Earth's Bond albedo is near the minimum possible for habitable planets orbiting G stars, because of increasing contributions from clouds and sea ice/snow at higher and lower instellations, respectively. For habitable M star planets, Bond albedo is usually lower than Earth's because of near-IR H\textsubscript{2}O absorption, except at high instellation where clouds are important. We apply relationships derived from this behavior to several known exoplanets to derive zeroth-order estimates of their potential habitability. More expansive multivariate statistical models that include currently non-observable parameters show that greenhouse gas variations produce significant variance in albedo and surface temperature, while increasing length of day and land fraction decrease surface temperature; insights for other parameters are limited by our sampling. We discuss how emerging information from global climate models might resolve some degeneracies and help focus scarce observing resources on the most promising planets.},

In order to place constraints on the atmospheric properties of the three closest terrestrial exoplanets transiting M dwarfs, we observe the high-energy spectra of the host stars LTT 1445A and GJ 486 in the X-ray with XMM-Newton and Chandra and in the ultraviolet with HST/COS and STIS. We combine these observations with estimates of extreme-ultraviolet flux, reconstructions of the Ly{$\alpha$} lines, and stellar models at optical and infrared wavelengths to produce panchromatic spectra from 1 {\AA} to 20 {\textmu}m for each star. While LTT 1445Ab, LTT 1445Ac, and GJ 486b do not possess primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, we calculate that they are able to retain pure CO\textsubscript{2} atmospheres if starting with 10, 15, and 50\% of Earth's total CO\textsubscript{2} budget, respectively, in the presence of their host stars' stellar wind. We use age-activity relationships to place lower limits of 2.2 and 6.6 Gyr on the ages of the host stars LTT 1445A and GJ 486. Despite both LTT 1445A and GJ 486 appearing inactive at optical wavelengths, we detect flares at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths for both stars. In particular, GJ 486 exhibits two far-ultraviolet flares with absolute energies of 10\textsuperscript{29.5} and 10\textsuperscript{30.1} erg (equivalent durations of 4357 {\textpm} 96 and 19 724 {\textpm} 169 s) occurring 3 h apart. Based on the timing of the observations, we suggest that these high-energy flares are related and indicative of heightened flaring activity that lasts for a period of days, but our interpretations are limited by sparse time-sampling. Consistent high-energy monitoring is needed to determine the duration and extent of high-energy activity on individual M dwarfs and the population as a whole.},

The nearby mid-M dwarf LHS 3844 hosts a terrestrial world that lacks a substantial atmosphere. We present a time-series UV spectrum of LHS 3844 from 1131 to 3215 {\AA} captured by HST/COS. We detect one flare in the FUV that has an absolute energy of 8.96 {\textpm} 0.77 {\texttimes} 10\textsuperscript{28} erg and an equivalent duration of 355 {\textpm} 31 s. We extract the flare and quiescent UV spectra separately. For each spectrum, we estimate the Ly{$\alpha$} flux using correlations between UV line strengths. We use Swift-XRT to place an upper limit on the soft X-ray flux and construct a differential emission model to estimate flux that is obscured by the interstellar medium. We compare the differential emission model flux estimates in the XUV to other methods that rely on scaling from the Ly{$\alpha$}, Si iv, and N v lines in the UV. The XUV, FUV, and NUV flux of LHS 3844 relative to its bolometric luminosity is log\textsubscript{10}(L\textsubscript{band}/L\textsubscript{Bol}) =-3.65, -4.16, and -4.48, respectively, for the quiescent state. These values agree with trends in high-energy flux as a function of stellar effective temperature found by the MUSCLES survey for a sample of early-M dwarfs. Many of the most spectroscopically accessible terrestrial exoplanets orbit inactive mid-to-late M dwarfs like LHS 3844. Measurements of M dwarf high-energy spectra are preferable for exoplanet characterization but are not always possible.

Experimental petrology provides the fundamental properties of the ability of water and melt to mix. So far, these data have been largely neglected for exoplanet mass-radius modeling. Here we present an advanced interior model for water-rich rocky exoplanets. The new model allows us to test the effects of rock melting and the redistribution of water between magma ocean and atmosphere on calculated planet radii. Models with and without rock melting and water partitioning lead to deviations in planet radius of up to 16\% for a fixed bulk composition and planet mass. This is within the current accuracy limits for individual systems and statistically testable on a population level. Unrecognized mantle melting and volatile redistribution in retrievals may thus underestimate the inferred planetary bulk water content by up to 1 order of magnitude.},

The two-component model for the formation of terrestrial planets as proposed by A. E. Ringwood ( Geochem. J. 11, 111-135 (1977) and On the Origin of the Earth and Moon, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1979) and H. Wa{\textasciidieresis}nke ( Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London, Ser. A 303, 287-302 (1981) is further substantiated. It is argued that almost all of the H \textsubscript{2}O added to Mars during its homogeneous accretion was converted on reaction with metallic Fe to H \textsubscript{2}, which escaped. By comparing the solubilities of H \textsubscript{2}O and HCl in molten silicates, the amount of H \textsubscript{2}O left in the mantle of Mars at the end of accretion can be related to the abundance of Cl. In this way an H \textsubscript{2}O content in the Martian mantle of 36 ppm is obtained, corresponding to an ocean covering the whole planet to a depth of about 130 m. The huge quantities of H \textsubscript{2} produced by the reaction of H \textsubscript{2}O with metallic iron should also have removed other volatile species by hydrodynamic escape. Thus it is postulated that the present atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars were formed by degassing the interiors of the planets, after the production of H \textsubscript{2} had ceased, i.e., after metallic iron was no longer available. It is also postulated that the large differences in the amounts of primordial rare gases in the atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars are due mainly to different loss factors. Except for gaseous species, Mars is found to be richer in volatile (halogens) and moderately volatile elements than the Earth. The resulting low release factor of \textsuperscript{40}Ar for Mars is attributed to a low degree of fractionation, leading to a relatively small crustal enrichment of even the most incompatible elements like K.},

Here we present five new occultations of TRAPPIST-1 b observed with MIRI in an additional photometric band at 12.8 {$\mu$}m. We perform a global fit of the ten eclipses and derive a planet-to-star flux ratio and 1{$\sigma$} error of 452 {\textpm} 86 ppm and 775 {\textpm} 90 ppm at 12.8 {$\mu$}m and 15 {$\mu$}m, respectively. We find that two main scenarios emerge. An airless planet model with an unweathered (fresh) ultramafic surface, that could be indicative of relatively recent geological processes, fits the data well. Alternatively, a thick, pure-CO2 atmosphere with photochemical hazes that create a temperature inversion and result in the CO2 feature being seen in emission also works, although with some caveats. Our results highlight the challenges in accurately determining a planet's atmospheric or surface nature solely from broadband filter measurements of its emission, but also point towards two very interesting scenarios that will be further investigated with the forthcoming phase curve of TRAPPIST-1 b.},

  abstract = {Context. With more than 1000 h of observation from Feb. 2016 to Oct. 2019, the Spitzer Exploration Program Red Worlds (ID: 13067, 13175 and 14223) exclusively targeted TRAPPIST-1, a nearby (12 pc) ultracool dwarf star, finding that it is orbited by seven transiting Earth-sized planets. At least three of these planets orbit within the classical habitable zone of the star, and all of them are well-suited for a detailed atmospheric characterization with the upcoming JWST. Aims: The main goals of the Spitzer Red Worlds program were (1) to explore the system for new transiting planets, (2) to intensively monitor the planets' transits to yield the strongest possible constraints on their masses, sizes, compositions, and dynamics, and (3) to assess the infrared variability of the host star. In this paper, we present the global results of the project. Methods: We analyzed 88 new transits and combined them with 100 previously analyzed transits, for a total of 188 transits observed at 3.6 or 4.5 {$\mu$}m. For a comprehensive study, we analyzed all light curves both individually and globally. We also analyzed 29 occultations (secondary eclipses) of planet b and eight occultations of planet c observed at 4.5 {$\mu$}m to constrain the brightness temperatures of their daysides. Results: We identify several orphan transit-like structures in our Spitzer photometry, but all of them are of low significance. We do not confirm any new transiting planets. We do not detect any significant variation of the transit depths of the planets throughout the different campaigns. Comparing our individual and global analyses of the transits, we estimate for TRAPPIST-1 transit depth measurements mean noise floors of {\textasciitilde}35 and 25 ppm in channels 1 and 2 of Spitzer/IRAC, respectively. We estimate that most of this noise floor is of instrumental origins and due to the large inter-pixel inhomogeneity of IRAC InSb arrays, and that the much better interpixel homogeneity of JWST instruments should result in noise floors as low as 10 ppm, which is low enough to enable the atmospheric characterization of the planets by transit transmission spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals a few outlier transits, but we cannot conclude whether or not they correspond to spot or faculae crossing events. We construct updated broadband transmission spectra for all seven planets which show consistent transit depths between the two Spitzer channels. Although we are limited by instrumental precision, the combined transmission spectrum of planet b to g tells us that their atmospheres seem unlikely to be CH4-dominated. We identify and model five distinct high energy flares in the whole dataset, and discuss our results in the context of habitability. Finally, we fail to detect occultation signals of planets b and c at 4.5 {$\mu$}m, and can only set 3-{$\sigma$} upper limits on their dayside brightness temperatures (611 K for b 586 K for c).

  abstract = {Characterizing the atmospheres of planets orbiting M dwarfs requires understanding the spectral energy distributions of M dwarfs over planetary lifetimes. Surveys like MUSCLES, HAZMAT, and FUMES have collected multiwavelength spectra across the spectral type's range of T\textsubscript{eff} and activity, but the extreme ultraviolet (EUV, 100-912 {\AA}) flux of most of these stars remains unobserved because of obscuration by the interstellar medium compounded with limited detector sensitivity. While targets with observable EUV flux exist, there is no currently operational facility observing between 150 and 912 {\AA}. Inferring the spectra of exoplanet hosts in this regime is critical to studying the evolution of planetary atmospheres because the EUV heats the top of the thermosphere and drives atmospheric escape. This paper presents our implementation of the differential emission measure technique to reconstruct the EUV spectra of cool dwarfs. We characterize our method's accuracy and precision by applying it to the Sun and AU Mic. We then apply it to three fainter M dwarfs: GJ 832, Barnard's star, and TRAPPIST-1. We demonstrate that with the strongest far-ultraviolet (FUV, 912-1700 {\AA}) emission lines, observed with the Hubble Space Telescope and/or Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, and a coarse X-ray spectrum from either the Chandra X-ray Observatory or XMM-Newton, we can reconstruct the Sun's EUV spectrum to within a factor of 1.8, with our model's formal uncertainties encompassing the data. We report the integrated EUV flux of our M dwarf sample with uncertainties of a factor of 2-7 depending on available data quality.},

Here I examine the conditions that allow early formation of a surface water ocean (simultaneous with cooling to clement surface conditions), and the timeline of degassing the planetary interior into the atmosphere. The greatest fraction of a planet's initial volatile budget is degassed into the atmosphere during the end of magma ocean solidification, leaving only a small fraction of the original volatiles to be released into the atmosphere through later volcanism. Rocky planets that accrete with water in their bulk mantle have two mechanisms for producing an early water ocean: First, if they accrete with at least 1 to 3 mass\% of water in their bulk composition, liquid water may be extruded onto the planetary surface at the end of magma ocean solidification. Second, at initial water contents as low as 0.01 mass\% or lower, during solidification a massive supercritical fluid and steam atmosphere is produced that collapses into a water ocean upon cooling. The low water contents required for this process indicate that rocky super-Earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly produce water oceans within tens to hundreds of millions of years of their last major accretionary impact, through collapse of their atmosphere.},

The apparent ubiquity of melting during giant accretionary impacts suggests that silicate and metallic material may be processed through multiple magma oceans before reaching solidity in a planet. The processes of magma ocean formation and solidification, therefore, strongly influence the earliest compositional differentiation and volatile content of the terrestrial planets, and they form the starting point for cooling to clement, habitable conditions and for the onset of thermally driven mantle convection and plate tectonics. This review focuses on evidence for magma oceans on planetesimals and planets and on research concerning the processes of compositional differentiation in the silicate magma ocean, distribution and degassing of volatiles, and cooling.},

We use bulk compositions drawn from primitive and differentiated meteorite compositions. Degassing alone can create a wide range of masses of planetary atmospheres, ranging from less than 1\% of the planet's total mass up to {\textasciitilde}6 percent by mass (mass\%) of hydrogen, {\textasciitilde}20 mass\% of water, and/or {\textasciitilde}5 mass\% of carbon compounds. Hydrogen-rich atmospheres can be outgassed as a result of oxidizing metallic iron with water, and excess water and carbon can produce atmospheres through simple degassing.

Aims: The influence of the proximity to a planet of the Roche lobe boundary on the critical temperature for blow-off conditions for estimating the increase of the mass loss rate through hydrodynamic blow-off for close-in exoplanets is investigated. Methods: We consider the gravitational potential for a star and a planet along the line that joins their mass centers and the energy balance equation for an evaporating planetary atmosphere including the effect of the stellar tidal force on atmospheric escape. Results: By studying the effect of the Roche lobe on the atmospheric loss from short-periodic gas giants we derived reasonably accurate approximate formulas to estimate atmospheric loss enhancement due to the action of tidal forces on a ``Hot Jupiter'' and to calculate the critical temperature for the onset of ``geometrical blow-off'', which are valid for any physical values of the Roche lobe radial distance. Using these formulas, we found that the stellar tidal forces can enhance the hydrodynamic evaporation rate from TreS-1 and OGLE-TR-56b by about 2 fold, while for HD 209458b we found an enhancement of about 50\%. For similar exoplanets which are closer to their host star than OGLE-TR-56b, the mass loss enhancement can be even larger. Moreover, we showed that the effect of the Roche lobe allows ``Hot Jupiters'' to reach blow-off conditions at temperatures which are less than expected due to the stellar X-ray and EUV heating.},

Our analysis found fourteen systems with significant detections in each of the phase curve components: planet's phase function, secondary eclipse, Doppler boosting, and ellipsoidal variations. We model the full phase curve simultaneously, including primary and secondary transits, and derive albedos, day- and night-side temperatures and planet masses. Most planets manifest low optical geometric albedos ({$<$} 0.25), with the exception of Kepler-10b, Kepler-91b, and KOI-13b. We find that KOI-13b, with a small eccentricity of 0.0006 {\textpm} 0.0001, is the only planet for which an eccentric orbit is favored. We detect a third harmonic for HAT-P-7b for the first time, and confirm the third harmonic for KOI-13b reported in Esteves et al.: both could be due to their spin-orbit misalignments. For six planets, we report a planetary brightness peak offset from the substellar point: of those, the hottest two (Kepler-76b and HAT-P-7b) exhibit pre-eclipse shifts or on the evening-side, while the cooler four (Kepler-7b, Kepler-8b, Kepler-12b, and Kepler-41b) peak post-eclipse or on the morning-side. Our findings dramatically increase the number of Kepler planets with detected planetary light offsets, and provide the first evidence in the Kepler data for a correlation between the peak offset direction and the planet's temperature. Such a correlation could arise if thermal emission dominates light from hotter planets that harbor hot spots shifted toward the evening-side, as theoretically predicted, while reflected light dominates cooler planets with clouds on the planet's morning-side.},

  abstract = {Stellar contamination has long been recognized as a major bottleneck in transmission spectroscopy, limiting our ability to accurately characterize exoplanet atmospheres, particularly for terrestrial worlds. In response, significant observational efforts have shifted toward emission spectroscopy as a potentially more robust alternative, exemplified by initiatives such as the 50 hour JWST "Rocky Worlds" Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) program. However, the extent to which emission spectroscopy may be affected by stellar effects remain mostly unexplored, in stark contrast with exploration and mitigation work for transmission spectroscopy. In this study, we assess the impact of imperfect knowledge of stellar spectra on exoplanet atmospheric retrievals from emission spectroscopy. For TRAPPIST-1, a 29 ppm precision on the 15 um eclipse depth is required to differentiate surface albedo with precision of 0.1 at 3 sigma confidence. Yet, we find that current 15 um eclipse depth estimations using different stellar models introduce a 40 to 80 ppm uncertainty. Moreover, such model precision should not be mistaken for a model accuracy, as we also find that JWST MIRI photometric observations of the star in-eclipse at 12.8 and 15 um, acquired with a 90 ppm 1 sigma precision, fall outside the range defined by existing models by 7 to 21 \%. This lack of precision and accuracy leads to a degeneracy in retrievals of planetary albedo and impacts the search for atmospheres, effects that could be solved by acquiring the true mid-IR spectrum of the star. We therefore recommend a revised observation design for JWST secondary eclipse measurements in which mid-IR stellar spectra should be systematically acquired alongside eclipse data.},

The active {\textasciitilde}22 Myr M dwarf AU Mic hosts two exoplanets orbiting interior to its debris disk. Therefore, this system provides a unique opportunity to quantify the effects of stellar X-ray and UV irradiation on planetary atmospheres as a function of both age and orbital separation. In this paper, we present over 5 hr of far-UV (FUV) observations of AU Mic taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS; 1070-1360 {\AA}) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We provide an itemization of 120 emission features in the HST/COS FUV spectrum and quantify the flux contributions from formation temperatures ranging from 104 to 107 K. We detect 13 flares in the FUV white-light curve with energies ranging from 1029 to 1031 erg s. The majority of the energy in each of these flares is released from the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona. There is a 100{\texttimes} increase in flux at continuum wavelengths {$\lambda$} {$<$} 1100 {\AA} in each flare, which may be caused by thermal Bremsstrahlung emission. We calculate that the baseline atmospheric mass-loss rate for AU Mic b is {\textasciitilde}108 g s-1, although this rate can be as high as {\textasciitilde}1014 g s-1 during flares with \$\{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{flare\}\}{\textbackslash}simeq \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{33\}\$ erg s-1.

We used new emissivity measurements of 15 basaltic samples between 2 {$\mu$}m and 25 {$\mu$}m to produce synthetic spectra and photometric fluxes. We found that the mid-infrared instrument can, in principle, distinguish several specific mineralogical and bulk chemical signals among relatively similar rocks. In particular, hydrous minerals, such as amphibole and serpentine, which would signal the existence of past or present water, can have observable characteristics in both low-resolution spectroscopy observations (with the precision of 5 eclipses) and the integrated fluxes over mid-infrared instrument filter bandwidths (20-100 eclipses). Photometric fluxes are also sensitive to bulk compositions (for example, wt\% Al\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}), which reflect magmatic processes. Our work demonstrates the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope and future observatories to access a fuller picture of exoplanet surface geology.},

  abstract = {Time-series photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths is becoming a common technique to search for atmospheres around rocky exoplanets. This method constrains the brightness temperature of the planet to determine whether heat redistribution is taking place - indicative of an atmosphere - or whether the heat is reradiated from a low albedo bare rock. By observing at 15\${$\mu\$$}m we are also highly sensitive to CO\$\_2\$ absorption. We observed three eclipses of the rocky super-Earth LHS 1140c using MIRI/Imaging with the F1500W filter. We found significant variation in the initial settling ramp for these observations and identify a potential trend between detector settling and the previous filter used by MIRI. We analysed our data using aperture photometry but also developed a novel approach which joint-fits pixel light curves directly using a shared eclipse model and a flexible multi-dimensional Gaussian process which models changes in the PSF over time. We demonstrate using simulated data that our method has the ability to weight away from particular pixels which show increased systematics, allowing for the recovery of eclipse depths in a more robust and precise way. Both methods and an independent analysis detect the eclipse at \${$>$}5{$\sigma\$$} and are highly consistent with a low albedo bare rock. We recover a dayside brightness temperature of \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{day\} = 561{\textbackslash}pm44\$ K, close to the theoretical maximum of \$T\_{\textbackslash}text\{day; max\} = 537{\textbackslash}pm9\$ K. We rule out a wide range of atmospheric forward models to \${$>$}3{$\sigma\$$} including pure CO\$\_2\$ atmospheres with surface pressure \${\textbackslash}ge10\$ mbar and pure H\$\_2\$O atmospheres with surface pressure \${\textbackslash}ge1\$ bar. Our strict constraints on potential atmospheric composition, in combination with future observations of the exciting outer planet LHS 1140b, could provide a powerful benchmark to understand atmospheric escape around M dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that high levels of X-ray and UV activity on young M dwarfs may drive rapid atmospheric escape on temperate, terrestrial planets orbiting within the habitable zone. However, secondary atmospheres on planets orbiting older, less active M dwarfs may be stable and present more promising candidates for biomarker searches. In order to evaluate the potential habitability of Earth-like planets around old, inactive M dwarfs, we present new Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of Barnard\&'s Star (GJ 699), a 10 Gyr old M3.5 dwarf, acquired as part of the Mega-MUSCLES program. Despite the old age and long rotation period of Barnard\&'s Star, we observe two FUV ({$\delta$}130 {$\approx$} 5000 s; E130 {$\approx$} 1029.5 erg each) and one X-ray (EX {$\approx$} 1029.2 erg) flares, and we estimate a high-energy flare duty cycle (defined here as the fraction of the time the star is in a flare state) of {$\sim$}25\%. A publicly available 5 {\AA} to 10 {$\mu$}m spectral energy distribution of GJ 699 is created and used to evaluate the atmospheric stability of a hypothetical, unmagnetized terrestrial planet in the habitable zone (rHZ {$\sim$} 0.1 au). Both thermal and nonthermal escape modeling indicate (1) the quiescent stellar XUV flux does not lead to strong atmospheric escape: atmospheric heating rates are comparable to periods of high solar activity on modern Earth, and (2) the flare environment could drive the atmosphere into a hydrodynamic loss regime at the observed flare duty cycle: sustained exposure to the flare environment of GJ 699 results in the loss of {$\approx$}87 Earth atmospheres Gyr-1 through thermal processes and {$\approx$}3 Earth atmospheres Gyr-1 through ion loss processes. These results suggest that if rocky planet atmospheres can survive the initial {$\sim$}5 Gyr of high stellar activity, or if a second-generation atmosphere can be formed or acquired, the flare duty cycle may be the controlling stellar parameter for the stability of Earth-like atmospheres around old M stars.},

  abstract = {Ground- and space-based planet searches employing radial velocity techniques and transit photometry have detected thousands of planet-hosting stars in the Milky Way. With so many planets discovered, the next step toward identifying potentially habitable planets is atmospheric characterization. While the Sun-Earth system provides a good framework for understanding the atmospheric chemistry of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars, the observational and theoretical constraints on the atmospheres of rocky planets in the habitable zones (HZs) around low-mass stars (K and M dwarfs) are relatively few. The chemistry of these atmospheres is controlled by the shape and absolute flux of the stellar spectral energy distribution (SED), however, flux distributions of relatively inactive low-mass stars are poorly understood at present. To address this issue, we have executed a panchromatic (X-ray to mid-IR) study of the SEDs of 11 nearby planet-hosting stars, the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) Treasury Survey. The MUSCLES program consists visible observations from Hubble and ground-based observatories. Infrared and astrophysically inaccessible wavelengths (EUV and Ly{$\alpha$}) are reconstructed using stellar model spectra to fill in gaps in the observational data. In this overview and the companion papers describing the MUSCLES survey, we show that energetic radiation (X-ray and ultraviolet) is present from magnetically active stellar atmospheres at all times for stars as late as M6. The emission line luminosities of C IV and Mg II are strongly correlated with band-integrated luminosities and we present empirical relations that can be used to estimate broadband FUV and XUV ({$\equiv$}X-ray + EUV) fluxes from individual stellar emission line measurements. We find that while the slope of the SED, FUV/NUV, increases by approximately two orders of magnitude form early K to late M dwarfs ({$\approx$}0.01-1), the absolute FUV and XUV flux levels at their corresponding HZ distances are constant to within factors of a few, spanning the range 10-70 erg cm-2 s-1 in the HZ. Despite the lack of strong stellar activity indicators in their optical spectra, several of the M dwarfs in our sample show spectacular UV flare emission in their light curves. We present an example with flare/quiescent ultraviolet flux ratios of the order of 100:1 where the transition region energy output during the flare is comparable to the total quiescent luminosity of the star Eflare(UV) {$\sim$} 0.3 L*{$\Delta$}t ({$\Delta$}t = 1 s). Finally, we interpret enhanced L(line)/LBol ratios for C IV and N v as tentative observational evidence for the interaction of planets with large planetary mass-to-orbital distance ratios (Mplan/aplan) with the transition regions of their host stars.

Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11\% precision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding               Gaia               astrometry, the errors are now 3\%. Planet radius measurements are, in turn, improved to 5\% precision. With a catalog of {$\sim$}1000 planets with precise properties, we probed in fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two classes of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes. Our previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally under-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet sizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is partially filled in. Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a planet's orbital distance and its host-star mass, both of which are related to a planet's X-ray/UV irradiation history. For lower-mass stars, the bimodal planet distribution shifts to smaller sizes, consistent with smaller stars producing smaller planet cores. Details of the size distribution including the extent of the ``sub-Neptune desert'' and the width and slope of the gap support the view that photoevaporation of low-density atmospheres is the dominant evolutionary determinant of the planet size distribution.},

  abstract = {The C-H-O-N-S elements that constitute the outgassed atmosphere and exosphere have likely been delivered by chondritic materials to the Earth during planetary accretion and subsequently processed over billions of years of planetary differentiation. Although these elements are generally considered to be volatile, a~large part of the accreted C-H-O-N-S on Earth must have been sequestered in the core and mantle, with the remaining part concentrated at the Earth's surface (exosphere: \${\textbackslash}text\{atmosphere\} + {\textbackslash}text\{ocean\} + {\textbackslash}text\{crust\}\$). The likely reason for this is that, depending on the prevailing pressure (P), temperature (T) and oxidation state (oxygen fugacity, fO2) in the planet's interior, the C-H-O-N-S elements can behave as siderophile, lithophile, refractory, magmatophile, or atmophile. It is not clear if these elements might be sequestered in the interiors of planets elsewhere, since the governing parameters of P-T-fO2 during the diverse magmatic processes controlling magmatic differentiation vary greatly over time and from planet to planet. The magma ocean outgassed the first atmosphere, which was probably also the largest in terms of mass, but its nature and composition remain poorly known. Meanwhile, a~significant, but unknown, part of the accreted C-H-O-N-S elements was sequestered in the core. These will probably never be liberated into the atmosphere. A~secondary atmosphere was then fuelled by volcanism, driven by mantle convection and most likely enhanced by plate tectonics. The Earth still has active volcanism, and the volume and volatile contents of its magma are closely linked to geodynamics. Earth's volcanoes have long emitted relatively oxidized gases, in contrast to Mars and Mercury. Mantle oxidation state seems to increase with planetary size, although the role of plate tectonics in changing the Earth's mantle oxidation state remains poorly understood. Water contents of magma from elsewhere in the solar system are not so different from those produced by the Earth's depleted mantle. Other elements (e.g. N, S, C) are unevenly distributed. A~great diversity of speciation and quantity of magmatic gas emitted is found in planetary systems, with the key inputs being: 1~-- degassing of the magma ocean, 2~-- mantle oxidation state (and its evolution), and 3~-- plate tectonics (vs. other styles of mantle convection). Many other parameters can affect these three inputs, of which planetary size is probably one of the most important.},

Added to this, the fact that the phase curve appears dominated by reflected starlight makes this close-in giant planet a unique study case. Here we investigate the information on coverage and optical properties of the planet clouds contained in the measured phase curve. We generate cloud maps of Kepler-7b and use a multiple-scattering approach to create synthetic phase curves, thus connecting postulated clouds with measurements. We show that optical phase curves can help constrain the composition and size of the cloud particles. Indeed, model fitting for Kepler-7b requires poorly absorbing particles that scatter with low-to-moderate anisotropic efficiency, conclusions consistent with condensates of silicates, perovskite, and silica of submicron radii. We also show that we are limited in our ability to pin down the extent and location of the clouds. These considerations are relevant to the interpretation of optical phase curves with general circulation models. Finally, we estimate that the spherical albedo of Kepler-7b over the Kepler passband is in the range 0.4--0.5.},

Hydrodynamic escape is generally thought to be driven by the flux of extreme-ultraviolet photons that the planet receives from its host star. Here, we show that the escape from planets orbiting hot stars proceeds through a different yet complementary process: drawing its energy from the intense near-ultraviolet emission of the star that is deposited within an optically thin, high-altitude atmospheric layer of hydrogen excited into the lower state of the Balmer series. The ultra-hot exoplanet KELT-9b likely represents the first known instance of this Balmer-driven escape. In this regime of hydrodynamic escape, the near-ultraviolet emission from the star is more important at determining the planet mass loss than the extreme-ultraviolet emission, and uncertainties in the latter become less critical. Further, we predict that gas exoplanets around hot stars may experience catastrophic mass loss when they are less massive than 1-2 Jupiter masses and closer in than KELT-9b, thereby challenging the paradigm that all large exoplanets are stable to atmospheric escape. We argue that extreme escape will affect the demographics of close-in exoplanets orbiting hot stars.},

The in situ atmospheric descent phase subsequently delivers definitive chemical and isotopic composition of the Venus atmosphere during an atmospheric transect above Alpha Regio. These in situ investigations of the atmosphere and near-infrared (NIR) descent imaging of the surface will complement remote flyby observations of the dynamic atmosphere, cloud deck, and surface NIR emissivity. The overall mission yield will be at least 60 Gbits (compressed) new data about the atmosphere and near surface, as well as the first unique characterization of the deep atmosphere environment and chemistry, including trace gases, key stable isotopes, oxygen fugacity, constraints on local rock compositions, and topography of a tessera.},

  abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

  abstract = {JWST observations of the seven-planet TRAPPIST-1 system will provide an excellent opportunity to test outcomes of stellar-driven evolution of terrestrial planetary atmospheres, including atmospheric escape, ocean loss, and abiotic oxygen production. While most previous studies use a single luminosity evolution for the host star, we incorporate observational uncertainties in stellar mass, luminosity evolution, system age, and planetary parameters to statistically explore the plausible range of planetary atmospheric escape outcomes. We present probabilistic distributions of total water loss and oxygen production as a function of initial water content, for planets with initially pure water atmospheres and no interior--atmosphere exchange. We find that the interior planets are desiccated for initial water contents below 50 Earth oceans. For TRAPPIST-1e, f, g, and h, we report maximum water-loss ranges of , , , and Earth oceans, respectively, with corresponding maximum oxygen retention of , , , and bars. We explore statistical constraints on initial water content imposed by current water content, which could inform evolutionary history and planet formation. If TRAPPIST-1b is airless while TRAPPIST-1c possesses a tenuous oxygen atmosphere, as initial JWST observations suggest, then our models predict an initial surface water content of 8.2 Earth oceans for these worlds, leading to the outer planets retaining {$>$}1.5 Earth oceans after entering the habitable zone. Even if TRAPPIST-1c is airless, surface water on the outer planets would not be precluded.},

The planet's high irradiation (16 times that of Earth) combined with the infrared luminosity and Jupiter-like size of its host star make it one of the most promising rocky exoplanet targets for detailed emission spectroscopy characterization with JWST.

Here, we consider whether these planets might instead be rocky worlds with thick, hot atmospheres. Can recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of TOI-270 d be understood in terms of such a model? We perform thermochemical equilibrium calculations to infer conditions of quenching of C--H--O--N species. Our results indicate apparent CO2--CH4 equilibrium between {$\sim$}900 and {$\sim$}1100 K. The CO abundance should be quenched higher in the atmosphere where the equilibrium CO/CO2 ratio is lower, potentially explaining a lack of CO. N2 is predicted to dominate the nitrogen budget. We confirm that the atmosphere of TOI-270 d is strongly enriched in both C and Ogas relative to protosolar H, whereas N is likely to be less enriched or even depleted. We attempt to reproduce these enrichments by modeling the atmosphere as nebular gas that extracted heavy elements from accreted solids. This type of model can explain the C/H and Ogas/H ratios, but despite supersolar C/N ratios provided by solids, the NH3 abundance will probably be too high unless there is a nitrogen sink in addition to N2. A magma ocean may be implied, and indeed the oxygen fugacity of the deep atmosphere seems sufficiently low to support the sequestration of reduced N in silicate melt. The evaluation presented here demonstrates that exoplanetary geochemistry now approaches a level of sophistication comparable to that achieved within our own solar system.},

  abstract = {GJ 367 is a bright (V {$\approx$} 10.2) M1 V star that has been recently found to host a transiting ultra-short period sub-Earth on a 7.7 hr orbit. With the aim of improving the planetary mass and radius and unveiling the inner architecture of the system, we performed an intensive radial velocity follow-up campaign with the HARPS spectrograph-collecting 371 high-precision measurements over a baseline of nearly 3 yr-and combined our Doppler measurements with new TESS observations from sectors 35 and 36. We found that GJ 367 b has a mass of M \textsubscript{b} = 0.633 {\textpm} 0.050 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} and a radius of R \textsubscript{b} = 0.699 {\textpm} 0.024 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}, corresponding to precisions of 8\% and 3.4\%, respectively. This implies a planetary bulk density of {$\rho$} \textsubscript{b} = 10.2 {\textpm} 1.3 g cm\textsuperscript{-3}, i.e., 85\% higher than Earth's density. We revealed the presence of two additional non-transiting low-mass companions with orbital periods of {\textasciitilde}11.5 and 34 days and minimum masses of \$\{M\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{c\}\}\}{\textbackslash}sin \{i\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{c\}\}\}\$ = 4.13 {\textpm} 0.36 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} and \$\{M\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{d\}\}\}{\textbackslash}sin \{i\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{d\}\}\}\$ = 6.03 {\textpm} 0.49 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}, respectively, which lie close to the 3:1 mean motion commensurability. GJ 367 b joins the small class of high-density planets, namely the class of super-Mercuries, being the densest ultra-short period small planet known to date. Thanks to our precise mass and radius estimates, we explored the potential internal composition and structure of GJ 367 b, and found that it is expected to have an iron core with a mass fraction of \$\{0.91\}\_\{-0.23\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}\$ . How this iron core is formed and how such a high density is reached is still not clear, and we discuss the possible pathways of formation of such a small ultra-dense planet. *Based on observations made with the ESO-3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory under programs 1102.C-0923 and 106.21TJ.001.},

I map these as a function of solar constant for planets ranging in size from Mars size to 10 Earth-mass. The states are: globally ice covered (Ts\&lt; 245K), cold and damp (270 \&lt; Ts\&lt; 290K), hot and moist (350\&lt; Ts\&lt; 550K) and very hot and dry (Ts\&lt; 900K). No stable climate exists for 290\&lt; Ts \&lt; 350K or 550 \&lt; Ts \&lt; 900K. The union of hot moist and cold damp climates describe the liquid water habitable zone, the width and location of which depends on planet mass. At each solar constant, two or three different climate states are stable. This is a consequence of strong non-linearities in both thermal emission and the net absorption of sunlight. Across the range of planet sizes, I account for the atmospheres expanding to high altitudes as they warm. The emitting and absorbing surfaces (optical depth of unity) move to high altitude, making their area larger than the planet surface, so more thermal radiation is emitted and more sunlight absorbed (the former dominates). The atmospheres of small planets expand more due to weaker gravity: the effective runaway greenhouse threshold is about 35Wm-2 higher for Mars, 10Wm-2 higher for Earth or Venus but only a few Wm-2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet. There is an underlying (expansion neglected) trend of increasing runaway greenhouse threshold with planetary size (40Wm-2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet than for Mars). Summing these opposing trends means that Venus-size (or slightly smaller) planets are most susceptible to a runaway greenhouse. The habitable zone for pure water atmospheres is very narrow, with an insolation range of 0.07 times the solar constant. A wider habitable zone requires background gas and greenhouse gas; N2 and CO2 on Earth, which are biologically controlled. Thus, habitability depends on inhabitance.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The habitability of the surface of any planet is determined by a complex evolution of its interior, surface, and atmosphere. The electromagnetic and particle radiation of stars drive thermal, chemical, and physical alteration of planetary atmospheres, including escape. Many known extrasolar planets experience vastly different stellar environments than those in our solar system: It is crucial to understand the broad range of processes that lead to atmospheric escape and evolution under a wide range of conditions if we are to assess the habitability of worlds around other stars. One problem encountered between the planetary and the astrophysics communities is a lack of common language for describing escape processes. Each community has customary approximations that may be questioned by the other, such as the hypothesis of H-dominated thermosphere for astrophysicists or the Sun-like nature of the stars for planetary scientists. Since exoplanets are becoming one of the main targets for the detection of life, a common set of definitions and hypotheses are required. We review the different escape mechanisms proposed for the evolution of planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres. We propose a common definition for the different escape mechanisms, and we show the important parameters to take into account when evaluating the escape at a planet in time. We show that the paradigm of the magnetic field as an atmospheric shield should be changed and that recent work on the history of Xenon in Earth's atmosphere gives an elegant explanation to its enrichment in heavier isotopes: the so-called Xenon paradox.           ,              Plain Language Summary             In addition to having the right surface temperature, a planet needs an atmosphere to keep surface liquid water stable. Although many planets have been found that may lie in the right temperature range, the existence of an atmosphere is not guaranteed. In particular, for planets that are kept warm by being close to dim stars, there are a number of ways that the star may remove a planetary atmosphere. These atmospheric escape processes depend on the behavior of the star as well as the nature of the planet, including the presence of a planetary magnetic field. Under certain conditions, a magnetic field can protect a planet's atmosphere from the loss due to the direct impact of the stellar wind, but it may actually enhance total atmospheric loss by connecting to the highly variable magnetic field of the stellar wind. These enhancements happen especially for planets close to dim stars. We review the complete range of atmospheric loss processes driven by interaction between a planet and a star to aid in the identification of planets that are both the correct temperature for liquid water and that have a chance of maintaining an atmosphere over long periods of~time.           ,              Key Points                                                                The different escape processes at planets and exoplanets are reviewed along with their mathematical formulation                                                     The major parameters for each escape processes are described; some escape processes negligible in the solar system may be major source at exoplanets, or for the early solar system                                                     A magnetic field should not be a priori considered as a protection for the atmosphere},

  abstract = {Dwarf planets Eris and Makemake have surfaces bearing methane ice of unknown origin. This ice can provide important insights into the origin and evolution of volatiles in the outer solar system. Deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratios were recently determined from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of Eris and Makemake (Grundy et al., 2024b), giving us new clues to decipher the origin of methane. Here, we develop geochemical models to test if the origin of methane could be primordial, derived from CO\textsubscript{2} or CO ("abiotic"), or sourced by organics ("thermogenic"). We find that primordial methane (as currently understood) is inconsistent with the observational data, whereas both abiotic and thermogenic methane can have D/H ratios that overlap the observed ranges. This suggests that Eris and Makemake either never acquired much methane during their formation, or their original inventories were removed and then replaced by internally produced methane. Because producing abiotic or thermogenic methane likely requires temperatures above {$\sim$}150 {$^\circ$}C, we infer that Eris and Makemake have rocky cores that underwent substantial radiogenic heating. Their cores may still be warm/hot enough to make methane. This heating could have driven hydrothermal circulation at the bottom of an ice-covered ocean to generate abiotic methane, and/or metamorphic reactions involving accreted organic matter could have occurred in response to heating in the deeper interior, generating thermogenic methane. Additional analyses of relevant thermal evolution model results and theoretical predictions of the D/H ratio of methane in the solar nebula support our findings of elevated subsurface temperatures and an apparent lack of primordial methane on Eris and Makemake. It remains an open question whether their D/H ratios may have evolved subsequent to methane outgassing.

  abstract = {Past studies have demonstrated that atmospheric escape by the core-powered mass-loss mechanism can explain a multitude of observations associated with the radius valley that separates the super-Earth and sub-Neptune planet populations. Complementing such studies, in this work, we present a shortlist of planets that could be losing their atmospheres today if their evolution is indeed primarily dictated by core-powered mass-loss. We use Bayesian inference analysis on our planet evolution and mass-loss model to estimate the posteriors of the parameters that encapsulate the current state of a given planet, given their published masses, radii, and host star properties. Our models predict that the following planets could be losing their atmospheres today at a rate {$\greaterequivlnt$}10\textsuperscript{7} g s\textsuperscript{-1} at 50 per cent confidence level: pi Men c, Kepler-60 d, Kepler-60 b, HD 86226 c, EPIC 249893012 b, Kepler-107 c, HD 219134 b, Kepler-80 e, Kepler-138 d, and GJ 9827 d. As a by-product of our Bayesian inference analysis, we were also able to identify planets that most-likely harbour either secondary atmospheres abundant with high mean-molecular weight species, low-density interiors abundant with ices, or both. The planets belonging to this second category are WASP-47 e, Kepler-78 b, Kepler-10 b, CoRoT-7 b, HD 80653 b, 55 Cnc e, and Kepler-36 b. While the aforementioned lists are by no means exhaustive, we believe that candidates presented here can serve as useful input for target selection for future surveys and for testing the importance of core-powered mass-loss in individual planetary systems.},

In this work, we investigate the effect of a planet's own cooling luminosity on its thermal evolution and atmospheric mass loss (core-powered mass-loss) and determine its observational consequences for the radius distribution of small, close-in exoplanets. Using simple analytical descriptions and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that planetary evolution based on the core-powered mass-loss mechanism alone (i.e. without any photoevaporation) can produce the observed valley in the radius distribution. Our results match the valley's location, shape and slope in planet radius--orbital period parameter space, and the relative magnitudes of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley. We find that the slope of the valley is, to first order, dictated by the atmospheric mass-loss time-scale at the Bondi radius and given by d\,logRp/d\,logP~{$\simeq~$}1/(3(1~-~{$\beta$})) that evaluates to -0.11 for {$\beta~\simeq~$}4, where Mc/M{$\oplus~$}=~(Rc/R{$\oplus$}){$\beta$}({$\rho$}c{$\ast$}/{$\rho\oplus$}){$\beta$}/3 is the mass--radius relation of the core. This choice for {$\beta$} yields good agreement with observations and attests to the significance of internal compression for massive planetary cores. We further find that the location of the valley scales as \${\textbackslash}rho \_\{{\textbackslash}rm c*\}{\textasciicircum}\{-4/9\}\$ and that the observed planet population must have predominantly rocky cores with typical water--ice fractions of less than \$\{{\textbackslash}sim \} 20\{\{{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash}, cent\}\}\$. Furthermore, we show that the relative magnitude of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley is sensitive to the details of the planet-mass distribution but that the location of the valley is not.},

  abstract = {Understanding the origins of the diversity in terrestrial planets is a fundamental goal in Earth and planetary sciences. In the Solar System, Venus has a similar size and bulk composition to those of Earth, but it lacks water. Because a richer variety of exoplanets is expected to be discovered, prediction of their atmospheres and surface environments requires a general framework for planetary evolution. Here we show that terrestrial planets can be divided into two distinct types on the basis of their evolutionary history during solidification from the initially hot molten state expected from the standard formation model. Even if, apart from their orbits, they were identical just after formation, the solidified planets can have different characteristics. A type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, solidifies within several million years. If the planet acquires water during formation, most of this water is retained and forms the earliest oceans. In contrast, on a type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, a magma ocean can be sustained for longer, even with a larger initial amount of water. Its duration could be as long as 100 million years if the planet is formed together with a mass of water comparable to the total inventory of the modern Earth. Hydrodynamic escape desiccates type II planets during the slow solidification process. Although Earth is categorized as type I, it is not clear which type Venus is because its orbital distance is close to the critical distance. However, because the dryness of the surface and mantle predicted for type II planets is consistent with the characteristics of Venus, it may be representative of type II planets. Also, future observations may have a chance to detect not only terrestrial exoplanets covered with water ocean but also those covered with magma ocean around a young star.},

  abstract = {Over the course of the past decade, advances in radial velocity and transit techniques have enabled the detection of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. Future observations with novel methods are required to characterize this sample of planets, especially those that are nontransiting. One proposed method is the Planetary Infrared Excess (PIE) technique, which would enable the characterization of nontransiting planets by measuring the excess IR flux from the planet relative to the star's spectral energy distribution. In this work, we predict the efficacy of future observations using the PIE technique by potential future observatories such as the MIRECLE mission concept. To do so, we conduct a broad suite of 21 general circulation model (GCM) simulations, with ExoCAM, of seven nearby habitable zone targets for three choices of atmospheric composition with varying partial pressure of CO2. We then construct thermal phase curves and emission spectra by post-processing our ExoCAM GCM simulations with the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). We find that all cases have distinguishable carbon dioxide and water features assuming a 90{$^\circ$} orbital inclination. Notably, we predict that CO2 is potentially detectable at 15 {$\mu$}m with MIRECLE for at least four nearby known nontransiting rocky planet candidate targets in the habitable zone: Proxima Centauri b, GJ 1061 d, GJ 1002 b, and Teegarden's Star c. Our ExoCAM GCMs and PSG post-processing demonstrate the potential to observationally characterize nearby nontransiting rocky planets and better constrain the potential for habitability in our solar neighborhood.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets is one of the major questions in exoplanet astronomy, but there are currently no published unambiguous detections of atmospheres on any rocky exoplanets. The MIRI instrument on JWST can measure thermal emission from tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting small, cool stars. This emission is a function of their surface and atmospheric properties, potentially allowing detections of atmospheres. One way to find atmospheres is to search for lower dayside emission than would be expected for a blackbody planet. Another technique is to measure phase curves of thermal emission to search for nightside emission due to atmospheric heat redistribution. Here, we compare strategies for detecting atmospheres on rocky exoplanets. We simulate secondary eclipse and phase curve observations in the MIRI F1500W and F1280W filters for a range of surfaces (providing our open-access albedo data) and atmospheres on 30 exoplanets selected for their F1500W signal-to-noise ratio. We show that secondary eclipse observations are more degenerate between surfaces and atmospheres than suggested in previous work, and that thick atmospheres can support emission consistent with a blackbody planet in these filters. These results make it difficult to unambiguously detect or rule out atmospheres using their photometric dayside emission alone. We suggest that an F1500W phase curve could instead be observed for a similar sample of planets. While phase curves are time-consuming and their instrumental systematics can be challenging, we suggest that they allow the only unambiguous detections of atmospheres by nightside thermal emission.},

While currently challenging, future observatories such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable atmospheric observations of a diverse sample of temperate terrestrial worlds. Using thermal emission spectra that represent conventional predictions of atmospheric CO2 variability across the Habitable Zone (HZ), we assess the ability of the LIFE mission - as a specific concept for a future space-based interferometer - to detect CO2 trends indicative of the carbonate-silicate (Cb-Si) weathering feedback, a well-known habitability marker and potential biological tracer. Therefore, we explore the feasibility of differentiating between CO2 trends in biotic and abiotic planet populations. We create synthetic exoplanet populations based on geochemistry-climate predictions and perform retrievals on simulated thermal emission observations. The results demonstrate the robust detection of population-level CO2 trends in both biotic and abiotic scenarios for population sizes as small as 30 Exo-Earth Candidates (EECs) and the lowest assessed spectrum quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 10, and spectral resolution, R = 50. However, biased CO2 partial pressure constraints hinder accurate differentiation between biotic and abiotic trends. If these biases were corrected, accurate differentiation could be achieved for populations with \${\textbackslash}geq\$ 100 EECs. We conclude that LIFE can effectively enable population-level characterization of temperate terrestrial atmospheres and detect Cb-Si cycle driven CO2 trends as habitability indicators. Nevertheless, the identified biases underscore the importance of testing atmospheric characterization performance against the broad diversity expected for planetary populations.},

Molecular oxygen is among the strongest indicators of life on Earth, but it will be extremely difficult to detect via transmission spectroscopy. We used the Bioverse statistical framework to assess the ability to probe Earth-like O\textsubscript{2} levels on hypothetical nearby habitable zone exo-Earth candidates (EECs) using direct imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Assuming continued improvement in instruments and data processing, our analysis highlights the best-case scenarios. Earth-like O\textsubscript{2} levels could be probed on up to {$\sim$}7 and {$\sim$}19 EECs orbiting bright M dwarfs within 20 pc in a hypothetical 10 yr survey on the GMT and ELT, respectively. Four known super-Earth candidates, including Proxima Centauri b, could be probed for O\textsubscript{2} within about 1 week of observations on the ELT and a few months on the GMT. We also assessed the ability of the ELT to test the habitable zone oxygen hypothesis---that habitable zone Earth-sized planets are more likely to have O\textsubscript{2}---within a 10 yr survey using Bioverse. Testing this hypothesis requires either {$\sim$}one-half of the EECs to have O\textsubscript{2} or {$\sim$}one-third if {$\eta$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} is large. A Northern Hemisphere large-aperture telescope, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope, would expand the target star pool by about 25\%, reduce the time to probe biosignatures on individual targets, and provide an additional independent check on potential biosignature detections.},

Results indicate that prior to two billion years ago the Earth had a partially reduced atmosphere, which included N \textsubscript{2}, CO \textsubscript{2}, reduced carbon compounds, some NH \textsubscript{3}, but no free H \textsubscript{2}. Surface temperatures were higher than now, due to a large greenhouse effect. When free O \textsubscript{2} appeared the temperature fell sharply. Had Earth been only slightly further from the Sun, runaway glaciation would have occured at that time. Simulations also indicate that a runaway greenhouse would have occured early in Earth's history had Earth been only a few percent closer to the Sun. It therefore appears that, taking into account the possibilities of either runaway glaciation or a runaway greenhouse effect, the continously habitable zone about a solar-type star is rather narrow, extending only from roughly 0.95 to 1.01 AU.},

We have studied the structure of this primordial atmosphere under the assumptions that (1) it is spherically symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium, and (2) the net energy outflow (i.e., the luminosity) is constant throughout the atmosphere and is given by GMM/R with M = M/10 \textsuperscript{6}yr or M/10 \textsuperscript{7}yr where M and R are the mass and the radius of the proto-Earth, respectively. The results of calculations show that the temperature at the bottom of the atmosphere, namely, at the surface of the proto-Earth increases greatly with the mass of the proto-Earth and it is about 1500{$^\circ$}K for M = 0.25 M \textsubscript{E}. This high temperature is due to the blanketing effect of the opaque atmosphere. Thus, as long as the primordial solar nebula was existing, the surface temperature of the proto-Earth was kept high enough to melt most of the materials and, hence, the melted iron sedimented towards the center to form the Earth's core.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

Observed lines include H{$\alpha$}, P{$\alpha$}-P{$\epsilon$}, Br{$\beta$}, He I {$\lambda$}0.7062 {$\mu$}m, two Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) lines, and the He I IRT. We observe a reversed Paschen decrement from P{$\alpha$}-P{$\gamma$} alongside changes in the light-curve shapes of these lines. The continuum of all four flares is well described by blackbody emission with an effective temperature below 5300 K, lower than the temperatures typically observed at optical wavelengths. The 0.6-1 {$\mu$}m spectra were convolved with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) response, enabling us to measure the flare rate of TRAPPIST-1 in the TESS bandpass. We find flares of 1030 erg, large enough to impact transit spectra occur at a rate of \$\{3.6\}\_\{-1.3\}{\textasciicircum}\{+2.1\}\$ flare day-1, {\textasciitilde}10{\texttimes} higher than previous predictions from K2. We measure the amount of flare contamination at 2 {$\mu$}m for the TRAPPIST-1b and f transits to be 500 {\textpm} 450 and 2100 {\textpm} 400 ppm, respectively. We find up to 80\% of flare contamination can be removed, with mitigation most effective from 1.0-2.4 {$\mu$}m. These results suggest transits affected by flares may still be useful for atmospheric characterization efforts.},

M. Keck Observatory and the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory. Eighty-one of the planets were discovered from their transits in the K2 photometry, while five were found based on subsequent Doppler measurements of transiting planet-host stars. The sizes of the transiting planets range from Earth-size to larger than Jupiter (1--3 R\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} is typical), while the orbital periods range from less than a day to a few months. For 32 of the planets, the Doppler signal was detected with significance greater than 5{$\sigma$} (51 were detected with \&gt;3{$\sigma$} significance). An important characteristic of this catalog is the use of uniform analysis procedures to determine stellar and planetary properties. This includes the transit search and fitting procedures applied to the K2 photometry, the Doppler fitting techniques applied to the radial velocities (RVs), and the spectral modeling to determine bulk stellar parameters. Such a uniform treatment will make the catalog useful for statistical studies of the masses, densities, and system architectures of exoplanetary systems. This work also serves as a data release for all previously unpublished RVs and associated stellar activity indicators obtained by our team for these systems, along with derived stellar and planet parameters.},

  abstract = {The surface pressure of a planet's atmosphere influences its habitability, as it determines whether surface water can exist as a liquid. Surface pressure can evolve over many timescales, from the rotation period of a planet to its entire lifetime. One process that can affect surface pressure is impact cratering. Unlike most other atmospheric alteration processes, impact events can both deliver and remove gasses from an atmosphere. Whether the surface pressure will increase or decrease due to a single impact event depends on the characteristics of both the impactor and target. An open question remains: do atmospheres shrink or grow due to the net effects of many impacts? {$<$}P /{$>$}In this work, we study the net effect of a bombardment period's worth of impacts at Venus, Earth, and Mars. We use a Monte Carlo approach, randomly choosing the size, velocity, and volatile content of each impactor. The consequences of each impact are calculated using 7 different published models, as well as a composite model that we construct from the individual models. We use a variety of initial atmospheric pressures, including present-day pressure and a range of paleopressures from the time of a potential heavy bombardment period. {$<$}P /{$>$}We find that the models from the literature produce final atmospheric pressures that disagree for the same input parameters, sometimes by many orders of magnitude. In addition, if naively applied, several models produce nonphysical results. We suggest more impact processes should be incorporated into these models, and that modern hydrocode modeling should be undertaken to create a new, more accurate model for the change in atmospheric pressure resulting from impacts.},

The planet has been observed extensively with transmission spectroscopy14-22 and its thermal emission has been measured in broad photometric bands23-26. These observations disfavour a primordial H2/He-dominated atmosphere but cannot conclusively determine whether the planet has a secondary atmosphere27,28. Here we report a thermal emission spectrum of the planet obtained by the NIRCam and MIRI instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) from 4 to 12 {$\mu$}m. The measurements rule out the scenario in which the planet is a lava world shrouded by a tenuous atmosphere made of vaporized rock29-32 and indicate a bona fide volatile atmosphere that is probably rich in CO2 or CO. This atmosphere can be outgassed from and sustained by a magma ocean.},

  abstract = {Kepler has detected numerous exoplanet transits by measuring stellar light in a single visible-wavelength band. In addition to detection, the precise photometry provides phase curves of exoplanets, which can be used to study the dynamic processes on these planets. However, the interpretation of these observations can be complicated by the fact that visible-wavelength phase curves can represent both thermal emission and scattering from the planets. Here we present a semi-analytical model framework that can be applied to study Kepler and future visible-wavelength phase curve observations of exoplanets. The model efficiently computes reflection and thermal emission components for both rocky and gaseous planets, considering both homogeneous and inhomogeneous surfaces or atmospheres. We analyze the phase curves of the gaseous planet Kepler- 7 b and the rocky planet Kepler- 10 b using the model. In general, we find that a hot exoplanet's visible-wavelength phase curve having a significant phase offset can usually be explained by two classes of solutions: one class requires a thermal hot spot shifted to one side of the substellar point, and the other class requires reflective clouds concentrated on the same side of the substellar point. Particularly for Kepler- 7 b, reflective clouds located on the west side of the substellar point can best explain its phase curve. The reflectivity of the clear part of the atmosphere should be less than 7\% and that of the cloudy part should be greater than 80\%, and the cloud boundary should be located at 11{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 3{$^\circ$} to the west of the substellar point. We suggest single-band photometry surveys could yield valuable information on exoplanet atmospheres and surfaces.},

The inferred dayside brightness temperature of TRAPPIST-1 b at 15 {$\mu$}m is consistent with the planet having no atmosphere and therefore no mechanism by which to circulate heat to its nightside. In this Letter, we compare TRAPPIST-1 b's measured secondary eclipse depth to predictions from a suite of self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models in order to quantify the maximum atmospheric thickness consistent with the observation. We find that plausible atmospheres (i.e., those that contain at least 100 ppm CO\textsubscript{2}) with surface pressures greater than 0.3 bar are ruled out at 3{$\sigma$}, regardless of the choice of background atmosphere, and a Mars-like thin atmosphere with surface pressure 6.5 mbar composed entirely of CO\textsubscript{2} is also ruled out at 3{$\sigma$}. Thicker atmospheres of up to 10 bar (100 bar) are consistent with the data at 1{$\sigma$} (3{$\sigma$}) only if the atmosphere lacks any strong absorbers across the mid-IR wavelength range-a scenario that we deem unlikely. We additionally model the emission spectra for bare-rock planets of various compositions. We find that a basaltic, metal-rich, and Fe-oxidized surface best matches the measured eclipse depth to within 1{$\sigma$}, and the best-fit gray albedo is 0.02 {\textpm} 0.11. We conclude that planned secondary eclipse observations at 12.8 {$\mu$}m will serve to validate TRAPPIST-1 b's high observed brightness temperature, but are unlikely to further distinguish among the consistent atmospheric and bare-rock scenarios.},

For a grey gas, or for a gas which absorbs at all infrared wavelengths, equilibrium is impossible when the solar constant exceeds a critical value. Equilibrium therefore requires that the condensed phase evaporates into the atmosphere.Moist adiabatic and pseudoadiabatic atmospheres in which the condensing vapor is a major atmospheric constituent are considered. This situation would apply if the solar constant were supercritical with respect to an abundant substance such as water. It is shown that the condensing gas would be a major constituent at all levels in such an atmosphere. Photodissociation of water in the primordial Venus atmosphere is discussed in this context.},

Water was abundant on early Mars but disappeared as Mars became the cold, dry planet we see today. Loss of water to space played a major role in the history of this water. Variability of components of the atmosphere that can drive escape has taken place on all timescales, from interannual to the 105-, 106-, and {$>$}107-year timescales of obliquity variations to the 4 billion-year timescale of large-scale climate evolution. These variations have had a major impact on the behavior of the atmosphere, climate, and water. They also make it difficult to evaluate quantitatively where the water has gone. Despite this uncertainty, the observed enrichment in the ratio of deuterium/hydrogen requires that loss to space has been substantial. Mars is the nearest planet that potentially harbors life and that can be explored by humans, so its history of water is important. Mars atmosphere has varied on all timescales, from year to year to its 4 billion-year history, driving the evolution of water.

  abstract = {Observations of the Mars upper atmosphere made from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft have been used to determine the loss rates of gas from the upper atmosphere to space for a complete Mars year (16 Nov 2014 - 3 Oct 2016). Loss rates for H and O are sufficient to remove {$\sim$}2-3 kg/s to space. By itself, this loss would be significant over the history of the planet. In addition, loss rates would have been greater early in history due to the enhanced solar EUV and more-active Sun. Integrated loss, based on current processes whose escape rates in the past are adjusted according to expected solar evolution, would have been as much as 0.8 bar CO2 or 23 m global equivalent layer of H2O; these losses are likely to be lower limits due to the nature of the extrapolation of loss rates to the earliest times. Combined with the lack of surface or subsurface reservoirs for CO2 that could hold remnants of an early, thick atmosphere, these results suggest that loss of gas to space has been the dominant process responsible for changing the climate of Mars from an early, warmer environment to the cold, dry one that we see today.},

  abstract = {The "cosmic shoreline", a semi-empirical relation that separates airless worlds from worlds with atmospheres as proposed by Zahnle \& Catling (2017), is now guiding large-scale JWST surveys aimed at detecting rocky exoplanet atmospheres. We expand upon this framework by revisiting the shorelines using existing hydrodynamic escape models applied to Earth-like, Venus-like, and steam atmospheres for rocky exoplanets, and we estimate energy-limited escape rates for CH4 atmospheres. We determine the critical instellation required for atmospheric retention by calculating time-integrated atmospheric mass loss. Our analysis introduces a new metric for target selection in the Rocky Worlds DDT and refines expectations for rocky planet atmosphere searches in Cycle 4. Exploring initial volatile inventory ranging from 0.01\% to 1\% of planetary mass, we find that its variation prevents the definition of a unique clear-cut shoreline, though non-linear escape physics can reduce this sensitivity to initial conditions. Additionally, uncertain distributions of high-energy stellar evolution and planet age further blur the critical instellations for atmospheric retention, yielding broad shorelines. Hydrodynamic escape models find atmospheric retention is markedly more favorable for higher-mass planets orbiting higher-mass stars, with carbon-rich atmospheres remaining plausible for 55 Cancri e despite its extreme instellation. Dedicated modeling efforts are needed to better constrain the escape dynamics of secondary atmospheres, such as the role of atomic line cooling, especially for Earth-sized planets. Finally, we illustrate how density measurements can be used to statistically test the existence of the cosmic shorelines, emphasizing the need for more precise mass and radius measurements.},

  abstract = {We use an end-to-end model of planet formation, thermodynamic evolution, and atmospheric escape to investigate how the statistical imprints of evaporation depend on the bulk composition of planetary cores (rocky versus icy). We find that the population-wide imprints like the location of the ``evaporation valley'' in the distance-radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution clearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with the observed position of the valley suggests that close-in low-mass Kepler planets have a predominantly Earth-like rocky composition. Combined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that low-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline but were still undergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets losing all primordial H/He. For planets in this ``triangle of evaporation'' in the distance-radius plane, the degeneracy in composition is reduced. In the observed planetary mass-mean density diagram, we identify a trend to more volatile-rich compositions with an increasing radius (R/R {$\oplus$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.6 rocky; 1.6-3.0 ices, and/or H/He {$\greaterequivlnt$}3: H/He). The mass-density diagram contains important information about formation and evolution. Its characteristic broken V-shape reveals the transitions from solid planets to low-mass core-dominated planets with H/He and finally to gas-dominated giants. Evaporation causes the density and orbital distance to be anticorrelated for low-mass planets in contrast to giants, where closer-in planets are less dense, likely due to inflation. The temporal evolution of the statistical properties reported here will be of interest for the PLATO 2.0 mission, which will observe the temporal dimension.},

Methods: We develop a physical rotational evolution model constrained by observed rotation distributions in young stellar clusters. Using rotation, X-ray, EUV, and Ly-{$\alpha$} measurements, we derive empirical relations for the dependences of high energy emission on stellar parameters. Our description of X-ray evolution is validated using measurements of X-ray distributions in young clusters. Results: A star's X-ray, EUV, and Ly-{$\alpha$} evolution is determined by its mass and initial rotation rate, with initial rotation being less important for lower mass stars. At all ages, solar mass stars are significantly more X-ray luminous than lower mass stars and stars that are born as rapid rotators remain highly active longer than those born as slow rotators. At all evolutionary stages, habitable zone planets receive higher X-ray and EUV fluxes when orbiting lower mass stars due to their longer evolutionary timescales. The rates of flares follow similar evolutionary trends with higher mass stars flaring more often than lower mass stars at all ages, though habitable zone planets are likely influenced by flares more when orbiting lower mass stars. Conclusions: Our results show that single decay laws are insufficient to describe stellar activity evolution and highlight the need for a more comprehensive description based on the evolution of rotation that also includes the effects of short-term variability. Planets at similar orbital distances from their host stars receive significantly more X-ray and EUV energy over their lifetimes when orbiting higher mass stars. The common belief that M dwarfs are more X-ray and EUV active than G dwarfs is justified only when considering the fluxes received by planets with similar effective temperatures, such as those in the habitable zone.

  abstract = {Context. The thermal and chemical structures of the upper atmospheres of planets crucially influence losses to space and must be understood to constrain the effects of losses on atmospheric evolution. Aims: We develop a 1D first-principles hydrodynamic atmosphere model that calculates atmospheric thermal and chemical structures for arbitrary planetary parameters, chemical compositions, and stellar inputs. We apply the model to study the reaction of the Earth's upper atmosphere to large changes in the CO2 abundance and to changes in the input solar XUV field due to the Sun's activity evolution from 3 Gyr in the past to 2.5 Gyr in the future. Methods: For the thermal atmosphere structure, we considered heating from the absorption of stellar X-ray, UV, and IR radiation, heating from exothermic chemical reactions, electron heating from collisions with non-thermal photoelectrons, Joule heating, cooling from IR emission by several species, thermal conduction, and energy exchanges between the neutral, ion, and electron gases. For the chemical structure, we considered 500 chemical reactions, including 56 photoreactions, eddy and molecular diffusion, and advection. In addition, we calculated the atmospheric structure by solving the hydrodynamic equations. To solve the equations in our model, we developed the Kompot code and have provided detailed descriptions of the numerical methods used in the appendices. Results: We verify our model by calculating the structures of the upper atmospheres of the modern Earth and Venus. By varying the CO2 abundances at the lower boundary (65 km) of our Earth model, we show that the atmospheric thermal structure is significantly altered. Increasing the CO2 abundances leads to massive reduction in thermospheric temperature, contraction of the atmosphere, and reductions in the ion densities indicating that CO2 can significantly influence atmospheric erosion. Our models for the evolution of the Earth's upper atmosphere indicate that the thermospheric structure has not changed significantly in the last 2 Gyr and is unlikely to change signficantly in the next few Gyr. The largest changes that we see take place between 3 and 2 Gyr ago, with even larger changes expected at even earlier times.},

In this study, we apply a state-of-the-art physical model for the upper atmosphere of the Archean Earth to study the effects of different atmospheric CO2/N2 mixing ratios and solar activity levels on the escape of the atmosphere to space. We find that unless CO2 was a major constituent of the atmosphere during the Archean eon, enhanced heating of the thermosphere by the Sun's strong X-ray and ultraviolet radiation would have caused rapid escape to space. We derive lower limits on the atmospheric CO2 abundance of approximately 40\% at 3.8 billion years ago, which is likely enough to counteract the faint young Sun and keep the Earth from being completely frozen. Furthermore, our results indicate that the Sun was most likely born as a slow to moderate rotating young G-star to prevent rapid escape, putting essential constraints on the Sun's activity evolution throughout the solar system's history. In case that there were yet unknown cooling mechanisms present in the Archean atmosphere, this could reduce our CO2 stability limits, and it would allow a more active Sun.},

We observed X-ray variability of both stars on timescales from hours to months, including two strong X-ray flares from star A. The implied flaring rates are in agreement with past observations made with XMM-Newton, though these rates remain imprecise due to the relatively short total observation time. We find a clear, monotonic decline in the quiescent level of the star by a factor of 1.8 across 8 months, suggesting stellar variability that might be due to an activity cycle. If proven through future observations, DS Tuc A would be the youngest star for which a coronal activity cycle has been confirmed. The variation in our flux measurements across the four visits is also consistent with the scatter in empirical stellar X-ray relationships with Rossby number. In simulations of the possible evolution of the currently super-Neptune-sized planet DS Tuc A b, we find a range of scenarios for the planet once it reaches a typical field age of 5 Gyr, from Neptune size down to a completely stripped super-Earth. Improved constraints on the planet's mass in the future would significantly narrow these possibilities. We advocate for further Chandra observations to better constrain the variability of this important system.},

We use three independent pipelines to reduce the data from the three JWST visits and perform several tests to check for the significance of an atmosphere. Overall, our analysis does not uncover evidence of an atmosphere. Our null hypothesis tests find that none of our pipelines' transmission spectra can rule out a flat line, although there is weak evidence for a Gaussian feature in two spectra from different pipelines (at 2.3 and 2.9{$\sigma$}). However, the candidate features are seen at different wavelengths (4.3 {$\mu$}m versus 4.7 {$\mu$}m), and our retrieval analysis finds that different gas species can explain these features in the two reductions (CO\textsubscript{2} at 3.1{$\sigma$} compared to O\textsubscript{3} at 2.9{$\sigma$}), suggesting that they are not real astrophysical signals. Our forward-model analysis rules out a low-mean-molecular-weight atmosphere (\&lt;350{\texttimes} solar metallicity) to at least 3{$\sigma$}, and disfavors CH\textsubscript{4}-dominated atmospheres at 1--3{$\sigma$}, depending on the reduction. Instead, the forward models find our transmission spectra are consistent with no atmosphere, a hazy atmosphere, or an atmosphere containing a species that does not have prominent molecular bands across the NIRCam/F444W bandpass, such as a water-dominated atmosphere.

  abstract = {We provide estimates of atmospheric pressure and surface composition on short-period, rocky exoplanets with dayside magma pools and silicate-vapor atmospheres. Atmospheric pressure tends toward vapor-pressure equilibrium with surface magma, and magma-surface composition is set by the competing effects of fractional vaporization and surface-interior exchange. We use basic models to show how surface-interior exchange is controlled by the planet's temperature, mass, and initial composition. We assume that mantle rock undergoes bulk melting to form the magma pool, and that winds flow radially away from the substellar point. With these assumptions, we find that: (1) atmosphere-interior exchange is fast when the planet's bulk-silicate FeO concentration is low, and slow when the planet's bulk-silicate FeO concentration is high; (2) magma pools are compositionally well mixed for substellar temperatures {$\lessequivlnt$}2400 K, but compositionally variegated and rapidly variable for substellar temperatures {$\greaterequivlnt$}2400 K; (3) currents within the magma pool tend to cool the top of the solid mantle (``tectonic refrigeration'') (4) contrary to earlier work, many magma planets have time-variable surface compositions.},

  abstract = {Planets with 2 R\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} \&lt; R \&lt; 3 R\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} and orbital period \&lt;100 days are abundant; these sub-Neptune exoplanets are not well understood. For example, Kepler sub-Neptunes are likely to have deep magma oceans in contact with their atmospheres, but little is known about the effect of the magma on the atmosphere. Here we study this effect using a basic model, assuming that volatiles equilibrate with magma at T {$\sim$} 3000 K. For our Fe-Mg-Si-O-H model system, we find that chemical reactions between the magma and the atmosphere and dissolution of volatiles into the magma are both important. Thus, magma matters. For H, most moles go into the magma, so the mass target for both H\textsubscript{2} accretion and H\textsubscript{2} loss models is weightier than is usually assumed. The known span of magma oxidation states can produce sub-Neptunes that have identical radius but with total volatile masses varying by 20-fold. Thus, planet radius is a proxy for atmospheric composition but not for total volatile content. This redox diversity degeneracy can be broken by measurements of atmosphere mean molecular weight. We emphasize H\textsubscript{2} supply by nebula gas, but also consider solid-derived H\textsubscript{2}O. We find that adding H\textsubscript{2}O to Fe probably cannot make enough H\textsubscript{2} to explain sub-Neptune radii because \&gt;10\textsuperscript{3} km thick outgassed atmospheres have high mean molecular weight. The hypothesis of magma-atmosphere equilibration links observables such as atmosphere H\textsubscript{2}O/H\textsubscript{2} ratio to magma FeO content and planet formation processes. Our model's accuracy is limited by the lack of experiments (lab and/or numerical) that are specific to sub-Neptunes; we advocate for such experiments.},

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) might be able to settle this question empirically, but most proposals for doing so require large observational effort because they are based on spectroscopy. Here we show that infrared photometry of secondary eclipses could quickly identify ``candidate'' atmospheres, by searching for rocky planets with atmospheres thick enough that atmospheric heat transport noticeably reduces their dayside thermal emission compared to that of a bare rock. For a planet amenable to atmospheric follow-up, we find that JWST should be able to confidently detect the heat redistribution signal of an \{ {\textbackslash}mathcal O \}(1) bar atmosphere with one to two eclipses. One to two eclipses is generally much less than the effort needed to infer an atmosphere via transmission or emission spectroscopy. Candidate atmospheres can be further validated via follow-up spectroscopy or phase curves. In addition, because this technique is fast it could enable a first atmospheric survey of rocky exoplanets with JWST. We estimate that the TESS mission will find {$\sim$}100 planets that are too hot to be habitable but that can be quickly probed via eclipse photometry. Knowing whether hot, rocky planets around M dwarfs have atmospheres is important not only for understanding the evolution of uninhabitable worlds: if atmospheres are common on hot planets, then cooler, potentially habitable planets around M dwarfs are also likely to have atmospheres.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric heat redistribution shapes the remote appearance of rocky exoplanets, but there is currently no easy way to predict a planet's heat redistribution from its physical properties. This paper proposes an analytical scaling theory for the heat redistribution on tidally locked rocky exoplanets. The main parameters of the scaling are a planet's equilibrium temperature, surface pressure, and broadband longwave optical thickness. The scaling compares favorably against idealized general circulation model simulations of TRAPPIST-1b, GJ1132b, and LHS 3844b. For these planets, heat redistribution generally becomes efficient, and a planet's observable thermal phase curve and secondary eclipse start to deviate significantly from that of a bare rock, once surface pressure exceeds \$\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal O \}(1)\$ bar. The scaling additionally points to planetary scenarios for which heat transport can be notably more or less efficient, such as H2 and CO atmospheres or hot lava ocean worlds. The results thus bridge the gap between theory and imminent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. They can also be used to parameterize the effect of 3D atmospheric dynamics in 1D models, thereby improving the self-consistency of such models.},

  abstract = {Future NASA concept missions that are currently under study, like the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) and the Large Ultra-violet Optical Infra Red Surveyor, could discover a large diversity of exoplanets. We propose here a classification scheme that distinguishes exoplanets into different categories based on their size and incident stellar flux, for the purpose of providing the expected number of exoplanets observed (yield) with direct imaging missions. The boundaries of this classification can be computed using the known chemical behavior of gases and condensates at different pressures and temperatures in a planetary atmosphere. In this study, we initially focus on condensation curves for sphalerite ZnS, \{\{\{H\}\}\}\textsubscript{2}\{\{O\}\}, \{CO\}\vphantom\{\}\textsubscript{2}, and \{CH\}\vphantom\{\}\textsubscript{4}. The order in which these species condense in a planetary atmosphere define the boundaries between different classes of planets. Broadly, the planets are divided into rocky planets (0.5-1.0 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}), super-Earths (1.0-1.75 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}), sub-Neptunes (1.75-3.5 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}), sub-Jovians (3.5-6.0 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}), and Jovians (6-14.3 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}) based on their planet sizes, and ``hot,'' ``warm,'' and ``cold'' based on the incident stellar flux. We then calculate planet occurrence rates within these boundaries for different kinds of exoplanets, {$\eta$} \textsubscript{planet}, using the community coordinated results of NASA's Exoplanet Program Analysis Group's Science Analysis Group-13 (SAG-13). These occurrence rate estimates are in turn used to estimate the expected exoplanet yields for direct imaging missions of different telescope diameters.},

  abstract = {Identifying terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of other stars is one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity (RV) and transit exoplanet surveys and proposed future space missions. Most current estimates of the boundaries of the HZ are based on one-dimensional (1D), cloud-free, climate model calculations by Kasting et al. However, this model used band models that were based on older HITRAN and HITEMP line-by-line databases. The inner edge of the HZ in the Kasting et al. model was determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the maximum greenhouse provided by a CO\textsubscript{2} atmosphere. A conservative estimate for the width of the HZ from this model in our solar system is 0.95-1.67 AU. Here an updated 1D radiative-convective, cloud-free climate model is used to obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K, and M stars. New H\textsubscript{2}O and CO\textsubscript{2} absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010 line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model. According to the new model, the water-loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse (outer HZ) limits for our solar system are at 0.99 and 1.70 AU, respectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge. Additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures between 2600 and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form, making them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near the inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway greenhouse and water-loss limits for stars with T \textsubscript{eff} \&lt;{\textasciitilde} 5000 K, which has implications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. This removes the dependence on planetary (Bond) albedo, which varies depending on the host star's spectral type. We suggest that conservative estimates of the HZ (water-loss and maximum greenhouse limits) should be used for current RV surveys and Kepler mission to obtain a lower limit on {$\eta$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}, so that future flagship missions like TPF-C and Darwin are not undersized. Our model does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.},

In this Letter, we present estimates of habitable zones (HZs) around stars with stellar effective temperatures in the range 2600 K-7200 K, for planetary masses between 0.1 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} and 5 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}. Assuming H\textsubscript{2}O-(inner HZ) and CO\textsubscript{2}-(outer HZ) dominated atmospheres, and scaling the background N\textsubscript{2} atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet, our results indicate that larger planets have wider HZs than do smaller ones. Specifically, with the assumption that smaller planets will have less dense atmospheres, the inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves outward ({\textasciitilde}10\% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets due to larger greenhouse effect arising from the increased H\textsubscript{2}O column depth. For larger planets, the H\textsubscript{2}O column depth is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor completely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. Hence the inner edge moves inward ({\textasciitilde}7\% higher than Earth's flux). The outer HZ changes little due to the competing effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo. New, three-dimensional climate model results from other groups are also summarized, and we argue that further, independent studies are needed to verify their predictions. Combined with our previous work, the results presented here provide refined estimates of HZs around main-sequence stars and provide a step toward a more comprehensive analysis of HZs.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial planets at the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) of late-K and M-dwarf stars are expected to be in synchronous rotation, as a consequence of strong tidal interactions with their host stars. Previous global climate model (GCM) studies have shown that, for slowly rotating planets, strong convection at the substellar point can create optically thick water clouds, increasing the planetary albedo, and thus stabilizing the climate against a thermal runaway. However these studies did not use self-consistent orbital/rotational periods for synchronously rotating planets placed at different distances from the host star. Here we provide new estimates of the inner edge of the HZ for synchronously rotating terrestrial planets around late-K and M-dwarf stars using a 3D Earth-analog GCM with self-consistent relationships between stellar metallicity, stellar effective temperature, and the planetary orbital/rotational period. We find that both atmospheric dynamics and the efficacy of the substellar cloud deck are sensitive to the precise rotation rate of the planet. Around mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with low metallicity, planetary rotation rates at the inner edge of the HZ become faster, and the inner edge of the HZ is farther away from the host stars than in previous GCM studies. For an Earth-sized planet, the dynamical regime of the substellar clouds begins to transition as the rotation rate approaches {$\sim$}10 days. These faster rotation rates produce stronger zonal winds that encircle the planet and smear the substellar clouds around it, lowering the planetary albedo, and causing the onset of the water-vapor greenhouse climatic instability to occur at up to {$\sim$}25\% lower incident stellar fluxes than found in previous GCM studies. For mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with high metallicity and for mid-K to early-M stars, we agree with previous studies.},

Theoretical models predict that these planets are more vulnerable to atmospheric loss than their counterparts orbiting Sun-like stars3-6. To determine whether a thick atmosphere has survived on a small planet, one approach is to search for signatures of atmospheric heat redistribution in its thermal phase curve7-10. Previous phase curve observations of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e (1.9 Earth radii) showed that its peak brightness is offset from the substellar point (latitude and longitude of 0 degrees)---possibly indicative of atmospheric circulation11. Here we report a phase curve measurement for the smaller, cooler exoplanet LHS 3844b, a 1.3-Earth-radii world in an 11-hour orbit around the small nearby star LHS 3844. The observed phase variation is symmetric and has a large amplitude, implying a dayside brightness temperature of 1,040 {\textpm} 40 kelvin and a nightside temperature consistent with zero kelvin (at one standard deviation). Thick atmospheres with surface pressures above 10 bar are ruled out by the data (at three standard deviations), and less-massive atmospheres are susceptible to erosion by stellar wind. The data are well fitted by a bare-rock model with a low Bond albedo (lower than 0.2 at two standard deviations). These results support theoretical predictions that hot terrestrial planets orbiting small stars may not retain substantial atmospheres.},

It is not known how a long-lived primary atmosphere might affect the subsequent habitability prospects of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we present a new, self-consistent evolutionary model of the transition from primary to secondary atmospheres. The model incorporates all Fe-C-O-H-bearing species and simulates magma ocean solidification, radiative-convective climate, thermal escape, and mantle redox evolution. For our illustrative example TRAPPIST-1, our model strongly favors atmosphere retention for the habitable zone planet TRAPPIST-1e. In contrast, the same model predicts a comparatively thin atmosphere for the Venus-analog TRAPPIST-1b, which would be vulnerable to complete erosion via non-thermal escape and is consistent with JWST observations. More broadly, we conclude that the erosion of primary atmospheres typically does not preclude surface habitability, and frequently results in large surface water inventories due to the reduction of FeO by H2.},

The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to characterize the atmospheres of these planets, potentially detecting CO\textsubscript{2}, CO, H\textsubscript{2}O, CH\textsubscript{4}, or abiotic O\textsubscript{2} from water photodissociation and subsequent hydrogen escape. Here, we apply a coupled atmosphere-interior evolution model to the Trappist-1 planets to anticipate their modern atmospheres. This model, which has previously been validated for Earth and Venus, connects magma ocean crystallization to temperate geochemical cycling. Mantle convection, magmatic outgassing, atmospheric escape, crustal oxidation, a radiative-convective climate model, and deep volatile cycling are explicitly coupled to anticipate bulk atmospheres and planetary redox evolution over 8 Gyr. By adopting a Monte Carlo approach that samples a broad range of initial conditions and unknown parameters, we make some tentative predictions about current Trappist-1 atmospheres. We find that anoxic atmospheres are probable, but not guaranteed, for the outer planets; oxygen produced via hydrogen loss during the pre-main sequence is typically consumed by crustal sinks. In contrast, oxygen accumulation on the inner planets occurs in around half of all models runs. Complete atmospheric erosion is possible but not assured for the inner planets (occurs in 20\%-50\% of model runs), whereas the outer planets retain significant surface volatiles in virtually all model simulations. For all planets that retain substantial atmospheres, CO\textsubscript{2}-dominated or CO\textsubscript{2}-O\textsubscript{2} atmospheres are expected; water vapor is unlikely to be a detectable atmospheric constituent in most cases. There are necessarily many caveats to these predictions, but the ways in which they misalign with upcoming observations will highlight gaps in terrestrial planet knowledge.},

  abstract = {Past studies addressing the thermal atmospheric escape of hydrogen from ``hot Jupiters'' have been based on the planet's effective temperature, which, as we show here, is not physically relevant for loss processes. In consequence, these studies led to significant underestimations of the atmospheric escape rate ({$<$}=103 g s-1) and to the conclusion of long-term atmospheric stability. From more realistic exospheric temperatures, determined from X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation and thermal conduction in the thermosphere, we find that energy-limited escape and atmospheric expansion arise, leading to much higher estimations for the loss rates ({\textasciitilde}1012 g s-1). These fluxes are in good agreement with recent determinations for HD 209458b based on observations of its extended exosphere. We also show that for young solar-type stars, which emit stronger XUV fluxes, the inferred loss rates are significantly higher. Thus, hydrogen-rich giant exoplanets under such strong XUV irradiances may evaporate down to their core sizes or shrink to levels at which heavier atmospheric constituents may prevent hydrodynamic escape. These results could explain the apparent paucity of exoplanets so far detected at orbital distances less than 0.04 AU.},

  abstract = {With temperatures around 700\,K and pressures of around 75\,bar, the deepest 12\,km of the atmosphere of Venus are so hot and dense that the atmosphere behaves like a supercritical fluid. The Soviet VeGa-2 probe descended through the atmosphere in 1985 and obtained the only reliable temperature profile for the deep Venusian atmosphere thus far. In this temperature profile, the atmosphere appears to be highly unstable at altitudes below 7\,km, contrary to expectations. We argue that the VeGa-2 temperature profile could be explained by a change in the atmospheric gas composition, and thus molecular mass, with depth. We propose that the deep atmosphere consists of a non-homogeneous layer in which the abundance of N2---the second most abundant constituent of the Venusian atmosphere after CO2---gradually decreases to near-zero at the surface. It is difficult to explain a decline in N2 towards the surface with known nitrogen sources and sinks for Venus. Instead we suggest, partly based on experiments on supercritical fluids, that density-driven separation of N2 from CO2 can occur under the high pressures of Venus's deep atmosphere, possibly by molecular diffusion, or by natural density-driven convection. If so, the amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere of Venus is 15\% lower than commonly assumed. We suggest that similar density-driven separation could occur in other massive planetary atmospheres.},

  abstract = {The increase in solar luminosity over geological timescales should warm the Earth's climate, increasing water evaporation, which will in turn enhance the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Above a certain critical insolation, this destabilizing greenhouse feedback can `run away' until the oceans have completely evaporated. Through increases in stratospheric humidity, warming may also cause evaporative loss of the oceans to space before the runaway greenhouse state occurs. The critical insolation thresholds for these processes, however, remain uncertain because they have so far been evaluated using one-dimensional models that cannot account for the dynamical and cloud feedback effects that are key stabilizing features of the Earth's climate. Here we use a three-dimensional global climate model to show that the insolation threshold for the runaway greenhouse state to occur is about 375 W m-2, which is significantly higher than previously thought. Our model is specifically developed to quantify the climate response of Earth-like planets to increased insolation in hot and extremely moist atmospheres. In contrast with previous studies, we find that clouds have a destabilizing feedback effect on the long-term warming. However, subsident, unsaturated regions created by the Hadley circulation have a stabilizing effect that is strong enough to shift the runaway greenhouse limit to higher values of insolation than are inferred from one-dimensional models. Furthermore, because of wavelength-dependent radiative effects, the stratosphere remains sufficiently cold and dry to hamper the escape of atmospheric water, even at large fluxes. This has strong implications for the possibility of liquid water existing on Venus early in its history, and extends the size of the habitable zone around other stars.},

After scaling to the planetary masses, surface excesses of 1{\texttimes}10 20 kg of C and 2.7{\texttimes}10 18 kg of N are calculated for Venus relatively to the Earth. The simplest proposed explanation is the storage of 25 ppm of C and 0.7 ppm of N in the Earth mantle due to lithospheric subduction, a mechanism not operating on Venus. Following the same line of arguments, the Earth has an excess surface water of about 1.2{\texttimes}10 21 kg of H 2O, when compared to Venus. Under the hypothesis of a primordial sizable water mass on Venus, thermodynamic modeling of mineral stabilities reveals that hydrous minerals are stable at the P- T conditions of both the surface and the deep crust of Venus, and thus could be the carriers of the missing Venusian water. A combination of crustal hydration and hydrogen escape processes may explain the present-day low amount and high deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio (2.5{\texttimes}10 -2) of water in the Venusian atmosphere relatively to the Earth's hydrosphere (1.55{\texttimes}10 -4). Alternatively, if the high D/H ratio of Venus only resulted from hydrogen escape, the reservoir of remaining oxygen must have been involved in the oxidation of a rock layer of about 50 km in depth.},

Planets that are smaller than {$\sim$}2 R\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} are considered to be largely rocky, either having been stripped of or never having acquired the gaseous envelope. Zooming in on this short-period rocky planet population, clear edges appear in the mass--period and radius--period space. Over {$\sim$}0.2--20 days and 0.09--1.42 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}, the maximum mass of the rocky planets stays below {$\sim$}10 M\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} with a hint of decrease toward {$\lessequivlnt$}1 day, {$\greaterequivlnt$}4 days, and {$\lessequivlnt$}0.45 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}. In radius--period space, there is a relative deficit of {$\lessequivlnt$}2 R\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} planets inside {$\sim$}1 day. We demonstrate how the edges in the mass--period space can be explained by a combination of tidal decay and photoevaporation, whereas the rocky planet desert in the radius--period space is a signature of magnetic drag on the planet as it orbits within the stellar magnetic field. Currently observed catastrophically evaporating planets may have started their death spiral from {$\sim$}1 day with planets of mass up to {$\sim$}0.3 M\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} under the magnetic drag. More discoveries and characterization of small planets around mid- to late M and A stars would be welcome to better constrain the stellar parameters critical in shaping the edges of rocky planet population, including their UV radiation history, tidal effects, and magnetic properties.},

If a Jupiter-like planet were to migrate toward its parent star the icy moons orbiting it would evaporate, creating atmospheres and possible habitable surface oceans. Here, we examine how long the surface ice and possible oceans would last before being hydrodynamically lost to space. The hydrodynamic loss rate from the moons is determined, in large part, by the stellar flux available for absorption, which increases as the giant planet and icy moons migrate closer to the star. At some planet-star distance the stellar flux incident on the icy moons becomes so great that they enter a runaway greenhouse state. This runaway greenhouse state rapidly transfers all available surface water to the atmosphere as vapor, where it is easily lost from the small moons. However, for icy moons of Ganymede's size around a Sun-like star we found that surface water (either ice or liquid) can persist indefinitely outside the runaway greenhouse orbital distance. In contrast, the surface water on smaller moons of Europa's size will only persist on timescales greater than 1 Gyr at distances ranging 1.49-0.74 au around a Sun-like star for Bond albedos of 0.2 and 0.8, where the lower albedo becomes relevant if ice melts. Consequently, small moons can lose their icy shells, which would create a torus of H atoms around their host planet that might be detectable in future observations.},

With a planetary mass of Mp = 5.6 +/- 1.2 Earth masses and a radius of Rp = 9.32 +/- 0.18 Earth radii, the observed properties of this planet are not readily explained by most planet formation theories. Hypotheses explaining Kepler-51d's low density range from a substantial H/He envelope comprising more than 30\% of its mass, to a high-altitude haze layer, to a tilted ring system. To test these hypotheses, we present the NIRSpec-PRISM 0.6-5.3 micron transmission spectrum of Kepler-51d observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. We find a spectrum best fit by a sloped line covering the entire wavelength range. Based on forward modeling and atmosphere retrievals, Kepler-51d likely possesses a low-metallicity atmosphere with high-altitude hazes of submicron particle sizes spanning pressures of 1-100 microbars. However, the spectrum could also be explained by a tilted ring with an estimated lifetime on the order of {\textasciitilde}0.1 Myr. We also investigate the stellar activity of this young Sun-like star, extracting a spot temperature significantly hotter than sunspots and spot covering fractions on the order of 0.1-10\%, depending on the assumed spot parameters.},

Each TRAPPIST-1 planet has been observed in transmission both from space and from the ground, confidently rejecting cloud-free, hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Secondary eclipse observations of TRAPPIST-1 b with JWST/MIRI are consistent with little to no atmosphere given the lack of heat redistribution. Here we present the first transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 b obtained with JWST/NIRISS over two visits. The two transmission spectra show moderate to strong evidence of contamination from unocculted stellar heterogeneities, which dominates the signal in both visits. The transmission spectrum of the first visit is consistent with unocculted starspots and the second visit exhibits signatures of unocculted faculae. Fitting the stellar contamination and planetary atmosphere either sequentially or simultaneously, we confirm the absence of cloud-free, hydrogen-rich atmospheres, but cannot assess the presence of secondary atmospheres. We find that the uncertainties associated with the lack of stellar model fidelity are one order of magnitude above the observation precision of 89 ppm (combining the two visits). Without affecting the conclusion regarding the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1 b, this highlights an important caveat for future explorations, which calls for additional observations to characterize stellar heterogeneities empirically and/or theoretical works to improve model fidelity for such cool stars. This need is all the more justified as stellar contamination can affect the search for atmospheres around the outer, cooler TRAPPIST-1 planets for which transmission spectroscopy is currently the most efficient technique.},

Together with the host star's Ly{$\alpha$} and far-UV (117-170 nm) radiation, EUV radiation photodissociates important molecules, thereby changing the chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres. Since stellar EUV fluxes cannot now be measured and interstellar neutral hydrogen completely obscures stellar radiation between 40 and 91.2 nm, even for the nearest stars, we must estimate the unobservable EUV flux by indirect methods. New non-LTE semiempirical models of the solar chromosphere and corona and solar irradiance measurements show that the ratio of EUV flux in a variety of wavelength bands to the Ly{$\alpha$} flux varies slowly with the Ly{$\alpha$} flux and thus with the magnetic heating rate. This suggests and we confirm that solar EUV/Ly{$\alpha$} flux ratios based on the models and observations are similar to the available 10-40 nm flux ratios observed with the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) satellite and the 91.2-117 nm flux observed with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite for F5 V-M5 V stars. We provide formulae for predicting EUV flux ratios based on the EUVE and FUSE stellar data and on the solar models, which are essential input for modeling the atmospheres of exoplanets.},

  abstract = {Transiting planet surveys like Kepler have provided a wealth of information on the distribution of planetary radii, particularly for the new populations of super-Earth- and sub-Neptune-sized planets. In order to aid in the physical interpretation of these radii, we compute model radii for low-mass rocky planets with hydrogen-helium envelopes. We provide model radii for planets 1-20 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}, with envelope fractions 0.01\%-20\%, levels of irradiation 0.1-1000 times Earth's, and ages from 100 Myr to 10 Gyr. In addition we provide simple analytic fits that summarize how radius depends on each of these parameters. Most importantly, we show that at fixed H/He envelope fraction, radii show little dependence on mass for planets with more than {\textasciitilde}1\% of their mass in their envelope. Consequently, planetary radius is to a first order a proxy for planetary composition, i.e., H/He envelope fraction, for Neptune- and sub-Neptune-sized planets. We recast the observed mass-radius relationship as a mass-composition relationship and discuss it in light of traditional core accretion theory. We discuss the transition from rocky super-Earths to sub-Neptune planets with large volatile envelopes. We suggest {\textasciitilde}1.75 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} as a physically motivated dividing line between these two populations of planets. Finally, we discuss these results in light of the observed radius occurrence distribution found by Kepler.},

  abstract = {The ultraviolet (UV) emission from the most numerous stars in the universe, M dwarfs, impacts the formation, chemistry, atmospheric stability, and surface habitability of their planets. We have analyzed the spectral evolution of UV emission from M0-M2.5 (0.3-0.6 M{$\odot$}) stars as a function of age, rotation, and Rossby number using Hubble Space Telescope observations of Tucana-Horologium (40 Myr), Hyades (650 Myr), and field (2-9 Gyr) objects. The quiescent surface flux of their C II, C III, C IV, He II, N V, Si III, and Si IV emission lines, formed in the stellar transition region, remains elevated at a constant level for 240 {\textpm} 30 Myr before declining by 2.1 orders of magnitude to an age of 10 Gyr. The Mg II and far-UV pseudocontinuum emission, formed in the stellar chromosphere, exhibits more gradual evolution with age, declining by 1.3 and 1.7 orders of magnitude, respectively. The youngest stars exhibit a scatter of 0.1 dex in far-UV line and pseudocontinuum flux attributable only to rotational modulation, long-term activity cycles, or an unknown source of variability. Saturation-decay fits to these data can predict an M0-M2.5 star's quiescent emission in UV lines and the far-UV pseudocontinuum with an accuracy of 0.2-0.3 dex, the most accurate means presently available. Predictions of UV emission will be useful for studying exoplanetary atmospheric evolution and the destruction and abiotic production of biologically relevant molecules and interpreting infrared and optical planetary spectra measured with observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {We show that terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs older than \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1 Gyr could have been in runaway greenhouses for several hundred Myr following their formation due to the star's extended pre-main sequence phase, provided they form with abundant surface water. Such prolonged runaway greenhouses can lead to planetary evolution divergent from that of Earth. During this early runaway phase, photolysis of water vapor and hydrogen/oxygen escape to space can lead to the loss of several Earth oceans of water from planets throughout the habitable zone, regardless of whether the escape is energy-limited or diffusion-limited. We find that the amount of water lost scales with the planet mass, since the diffusion-limited hydrogen escape flux is proportional to the planet surface gravity. In addition to undergoing potential desiccation, planets with inefficient oxygen sinks at the surface may build up hundreds to thousands of bars of abiotically produced O\$\_2\$, resulting in potential false positives for life. The amount of O\$\_2\$ that builds up also scales with the planet mass; we find that O\$\_2\$ builds up at a constant rate that is controlled by diffusion: \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 5 bars/Myr on Earth-mass planets and up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 25 bars/Myr on super-Earths. As a result, some recently discovered super-Earths in the habitable zone such as GJ 667Cc could have built up as many as 2000 bars of O\$\_2\$ due to the loss of up to 10 Earth oceans of water. The fate of a given planet strongly depends on the extreme ultraviolet flux, the duration of the runaway regime, the initial water content, and the rate at which oxygen is absorbed by the surface. In general, we find that the initial phase of high luminosity may compromise the habitability of many terrestrial planets orbiting low mass stars.},

We find that HECs are most likely to form from planets with \${\textbackslash}sim 1 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ solid cores with up to about 50\% H/He by mass, though whether or not a given mini-Neptune forms a HEC is highly dependent on the early XUV evolution of the host star. As terrestrial planet formation around M dwarfs by accumulation of local material is likely to form planets that are small and dry, evaporation of small migrating mini-Neptunes could be one of the dominant formation mechanisms for volatile-rich Earths around these stars.},

  abstract = {It is now understood that the accretion of terrestrial planets naturally involves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well-known example. In the aftermath of such collisions, the surface of the surviving planet is very hot and potentially detectable. Here we explore the atmospheric chemistry, photochemistry, and spectral signatures of post-giant-impact terrestrial planets enveloped by thick atmospheres consisting predominantly of CO\textsubscript{2} and H\textsubscript{2}O. The atmospheric chemistry and structure are computed self-consistently for atmospheres in equilibrium with hot surfaces with composition reflecting either the bulk silicate Earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere, and oceans) or Earth's continental crust. We account for all major molecular and atomic opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. We find that these atmospheres are dominated by H\textsubscript{2}O and CO\textsubscript{2}, while the formation of CH\textsubscript{4} and NH\textsubscript{3} is quenched because of short dynamical timescales. Other important constituents are HF, HCl, NaCl, and SO\textsubscript{2}. These are apparent in the emerging spectra and can be indicative that an impact has occurred. The use of comprehensive opacities results in spectra that are a factor of two lower brightness temperature in the spectral windows than predicted by previous models. The estimated luminosities show that the hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable with near-infrared coronagraphs on the planned 30 m class telescopes. The 1-4 {$\mu$}m will be most favorable for such detections, offering bright features and better contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. We derive cooling timescales on the order of 10\textsuperscript{5-6} yr on the basis of the modeled effective temperatures. This leads to the possibility of discovering tens of such planets in future surveys.},

We obtain transmission and emission spectra of the planet and characterize the properties of the phase curve, including its amplitude and offset. The transmission spectrum rules out clear H\$\_2\$-dominated atmospheres, while secondary atmospheres (made of water, methane, or carbon dioxide) cannot be statistically distinguished from a flat line. The emission spectrum is featureless and consistent with a blackbody-like brightness temperature, helping rule out thick atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Collecting all evidence, the properties of TOI-1685 b are consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo, with a dayside brightness temperature 0.98\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.07 times that of a perfect blackbody in the NIRSpec NRS2 wavelength range (3.823-5.172 um). Our results add to the growing number of seemingly airless M-star rocky planets, thus constraining the location of the "Cosmic Shoreline". Three independent data reductions have been carried out, all showing a high-amplitude correlated noise component in the white and spectroscopic light curves. The correlated noise properties are different between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors - importantly the timescales of the strongest components (4.5 hours and 2.5 hours, respectively) - suggesting the noise is from instrumental rather than astrophysical origins. We encourage the community to look into the systematics of NIRSpec for long time-series observations.},

  abstract = {Near-term studies of Venus-like atmospheres with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) promise to advance our knowledge of terrestrial planet evolution. However, the remote study of Venus in the solar system and the ongoing efforts to characterize gaseous exoplanets both suggest that high altitude aerosols can limit observational studies of lower atmospheres, and potentially make it challenging to recognize exoplanets as ``Venus-like.'' To support practical approaches for exo-Venus characterization with JWST, we use Venus-like atmospheric models with self-consistent cloud formation of the seven TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets to investigate the atmospheric depth that can be probed using both transmission and emission spectroscopy. We find that JWST/Mid-IR Instrument Low Resolution Spectrometer secondary eclipse emission spectroscopy in the 6 {$\mu$}m opacity window could probe at least an order of magnitude deeper pressures than transmission spectroscopy, potentially allowing access to the subcloud atmosphere for the two hot innermost TRAPPIST-1 planets. In addition, we identify two confounding effects of sulfuric acid aerosols that may carry strong implications for the characterization of terrestrial exoplanets with transmission spectroscopy: (1) there exists an ambiguity between cloud-top and solid surface in producing the observed spectral continuum; and (2) the cloud-forming region drops in altitude with semimajor axis, causing an increase in the observable cloud-top pressure with decreasing stellar insolation. Taken together, these effects could produce a trend of thicker atmospheres observed at lower stellar insolation---a convincing false positive for atmospheric escape and an empirical ``cosmic shoreline.'' However, developing observational and theoretical techniques to identify Venus-like exoplanets and discriminate them from stellar windswept worlds will enable advances in the emerging field of terrestrial comparative planetology.},

These analyses reveal that the star underwent a significant flaring event during one of the ACA observations on 2017 March 24. The complete event lasted for approximately 1 minute and reached a peak flux density of 100 {\textpm} 4 mJy, nearly a factor of 1000 times brighter than the star's quiescent emission. At the flare peak, the continuum emission is characterized by a steeply falling spectral index with frequency F \textsubscript{ {$\nu$} } {$\propto$} {$\nu$} \textsuperscript{ {$\alpha$} } with {$\alpha$} = -1.77 {\textpm} 0.45, and a lower limit on the fractional linear polarization of {\textbar} Q/I{\textbar} =0.19+/- 0.02.

We also posit that the slight excess flux density of 101 {\textpm} 9 {$\mu$}Jy observed in the 12 m observations, compared to the photospheric flux density of 74 {\textpm} 4 {$\mu$}Jy extrapolated from infrared wavelengths, may be due to coronal heating from continual smaller flares, as is seen for AU Mic, another nearby well-studied M dwarf flare star.

  abstract = {The mass-luminosity relation for late-type stars has long been a critical tool for estimating stellar masses. However, there is growing need for both a higher-precision relation and a better understanding of systematic effects (e.g., metallicity). Here we present an empirical relationship between \{M\}\{KS\} and M * spanning 0.075 M {$\odot$} {$<$} M * {$<$} 0.70 M {$\odot$}. The relation is derived from 62 nearby binaries, whose orbits we determine using a combination of Keck/NIRC2 imaging, archival adaptive optics data, and literature astrometry. From their orbital parameters, we determine the total mass of each system, with a precision better than 1\% in the best cases. We use these total masses, in combination with resolved K S magnitudes and system parallaxes, to calibrate the \{M\}\{KS\}-M * relation. The resulting posteriors can be used to determine masses of single stars with a precision of 2\%-3\%, which we confirm by testing the relation on stars with individual dynamical masses from the literature. The precision is limited by scatter around the best-fit relation beyond measured M * uncertainties, perhaps driven by intrinsic variation in the \{M\}\{KS\}-M * relation or underestimated uncertainties in the input parallaxes. We find that the effect of [Fe/H] on the \{M\}\{KS\}-M * relation is likely negligible for metallicities in the solar neighborhood (0.0\% {\textpm} 2.2\% change in mass per dex change in [Fe/H]). This weak effect is consistent with predictions from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database, but inconsistent with those from MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (at 5{$\sigma$}). A sample of binaries with a wider range of abundances will be required to discern the importance of metallicity in extreme populations (e.g., in the Galactic halo or thick disk).},

However, it is still unknown whether such planets orbiting close to M dwarf stars can retain their atmospheres, or whether high-energy irradiation from the star will strip the gaseous envelopes from these objects. We present a new method to detect an atmosphere on a synchronously rotating rocky exoplanet around a K/M dwarf, by using thermal emission during secondary eclipse to infer a high dayside albedo that could only be explained by bright clouds. Based on calculations for plausible surface conditions, we conclude that a high albedo could be unambiguously interpreted as a signal of an atmosphere for planets with substellar temperatures of T sub = 410-1250 K. This range corresponds to equilibrium temperatures of T eq = 300-880 K. We compare the inferred albedos of eight possible planet surface compositions to cloud albedo calculations. We determine that a layer of clouds with optical depths greater than {$\tau$} = 0.5-7, would have high enough albedos to be distinguishable from a bare rock surface. This method of detecting an atmosphere on a rocky planet is complementary to existing methods for detecting atmospheres, because it provides a way to detect atmospheres with pressures below 1 bar (e.g., Mars), which are too tenuous to transport significant heat but thick enough to host high-albedo clouds.},

  abstract = {The search for rocky planet atmospheres with JWST has focused on planets transiting M dwarfs. Such planets have favorable planet-to-star size ratios, enhancing the amplitude of atmospheric features. Since the expected signal strength of atmospheric features is similar to the single-transit performance of JWST, multiple observations are required to confirm any detection. Here, we present two transit observations of the rocky planet GJ 1132 b with JWST NIRSpec G395H, covering 2.8-5.2 {$\mu$}m. Previous Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 observations of GJ 1132 b were inconclusive, with evidence reported for either an atmosphere or a featureless spectrum based on analyses of the same data set. Our JWST data exhibit substantial differences between the two visits. One transit is consistent with either an H\textsubscript{2}O-dominated atmosphere containing {\textasciitilde}1\% CH\textsubscript{4} and trace N\textsubscript{2}O ( \$\{{\textbackslash}chi \}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}=1.13\$ ) or stellar contamination from unocculted starspots ( \$\{{\textbackslash}chi \}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}=1.36\$ ). However, the second transit is consistent with a featureless spectrum. Neither visit is consistent with a previous report of HCN. Atmospheric variability is unlikely to explain the scale of the observed differences between the visits. Similarly, our out-of-transit stellar spectra show no evidence of changing stellar inhomogeneity between the two visits-observed 8 days apart, only 6.5\% of the stellar rotation rate. We further find no evidence of differing instrumental systematic effects between visits. The most plausible explanation is an unlucky random noise draw leading to two significantly discrepant transmission spectra. Our results highlight the importance of multivisit repeatability with JWST prior to claiming atmospheric detections for these small, enigmatic planets.},

We show that these modeled environments can be habitable or uninhabitable at Proxima Cen b's position in the habitable zone. We use radiative transfer models to generate synthetic spectra and thermal phase curves for these simulated environments, and use instrument models to explore our ability to discriminate between possible planetary states. These results are applicable not only to Proxima Cen b but to other terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. Thermal phase curves may provide the first constraint on the existence of an atmosphere. We find that James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations longward of 10 {$\mu$}m could characterize atmospheric heat transport and molecular composition. Detection of ocean glint is unlikely with JWST but may be within the reach of larger-aperture telescopes. Direct imaging spectra may detect O\textsubscript{4} absorption, which is diagnostic of massive water loss and O\textsubscript{2} retention, rather than a photosynthetic biosphere. Similarly, strong CO\textsubscript{2} and CO bands at wavelengths shortward of 2.5 {$\mu$}m would indicate a CO\textsubscript{2}-dominated atmosphere. If the planet is habitable and volatile-rich, direct imaging will be the best means of detecting habitability. Earth-like planets with microbial biospheres may be identified by the presence of CH\textsubscript{4}---which has a longer atmospheric lifetime under Proxima Centauri's incident UV---and either photosynthetically produced O\textsubscript{2} or a hydrocarbon haze layer.},

  abstract = {Context. Terrestrial exoplanets orbiting nearby small cool stars, known as M dwarfs, are well suited for an atmospheric characterisation. Because the intense X-ray and UV (XUV) irradiation from M dwarf host stars is strong, orbiting exoplanets are thought to be unable to retain primordial hydrogen- or helium-dominated atmospheres. However, it is currently unknown whether heavier secondary atmospheres can survive. Aims. The aim of the Hot Rocks Survey programme is to determine whether exoplanets can retain secondary atmospheres in the presence of M dwarf hosts. In the sample of nine exoplanets in the programme, we aim to determine whether TOI-1468 b has a substantial atmosphere or is consistent with a low-albedo bare rock. Methods. The James Webb Space Telescope provides an opportunity to characterise the thermal emission with MIRI at 15 {$\mu$}m. The occultation of TOI-1468 b was observed three times. We compared our observations to atmospheric models that include varying amounts of CO2 and H2O. Results. The observed occultation depths for the individual visits are 239{\textpm}52 ppm, 341{\textpm}53 ppm, and 357{\textpm}52 ppm. A joint fit yields an occultation depth of 311{\textpm}31 ppm. The thermal emission is mostly consistent with no atmosphere and a zero Bond albedo at a confidence level of 1.65{$\sigma$}, or a blackbody at a brightness temperature of 1024 {\textpm} 78 K. A pure CO2 or H2O atmosphere with a surface pressure above 1 bar is ruled out at higher than 3{$\sigma$}. Conclusions. Surprisingly, the surface of TOI-1468 b is marginally hotter than expected. This indicates an additional source of energy on the planet. This source might originate from a temperature inversion or induction heating, or it might be an instrumental artefact. The results within the Hot Rocks Survey build on the legacy of studying the atmospheres of exoplanets around M dwarfs. The outcome of this survey will prove useful to the large-scale survey of M dwarfs that was recently approved by the STScI.},

  abstract = {The full range of conditions under which rocky planets can host atmospheres remains poorly understood, especially in the regime of close-in orbits around late-type stars. One way to assess the presence of atmospheres on rocky exoplanets is to measure their dayside emission as they are eclipsed by their host stars. Here, we present Spitzer observations of the 4.5 {$\mu$}m secondary eclipses of the rocky super-Earth TOI-431 b, whose mass and radius indicate an Earth-like bulk composition (3.07 {\textpm} 0.35 M{$\oplus$}, 1.28 {\textpm} 0.04 R{$\oplus$}). Exposed to more than 2000 times the irradiation of Earth, dayside temperatures of up to 2400 K are expected if the planet is a dark bare rock without a significant atmosphere. Intriguingly, despite the strong stellar insolation, we measure a secondary-eclipse depth of only 33 {\textpm} 22 ppm, which corresponds to a dayside brightness temperature of K. This notably low eclipse depth disagrees with the dark bare-rock scenario at the 2.5{$\sigma$} level, and suggests either that the planet is surrounded by an atmosphere or that it is a bare rock with a highly reflective surface. In the atmosphere scenario, the low dayside emission implies the efficient redistribution of heat to the nightside, or by molecular absorption in the 4--5 {$\mu$}m bandpass. In the bare-rock scenario, a surface composition made of a high-albedo mineral species such as ultramafic rock can lead to reduced thermal emission consistent with low eclipse depth measurement. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope hold the key to constraining the nature of the planet.},

  abstract = {Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, M-Earths, are currently the best targets to search for signatures of life. Life as we know it requires water. The habitability of M-Earths is jeopardized by water loss to space: high flux from young M-dwarf stars can drive the loss of 3-20 Earth oceans from otherwise habitable planets. We develop a 0-D box model for Earth-mass terrestrial exoplanets, orbiting within the habitable zone, which tracks water loss to space and exchange between reservoirs during an early surface magma ocean phase and the longer deep-water cycling phase. A key feature is the duration of the surface magma ocean, assumed concurrent with the runaway greenhouse. This time-scale can discriminate between desiccated planets, planets with desiccated mantles but substantial surface water, and planets with significant water sequestered in the mantle. A longer-lived surface magma ocean helps M-Earths retain water: dissolution of water in the magma provides a barrier against significant loss to space during the earliest, most active stage of the host M-dwarf, depending on the water saturation limit of the magma. Although a short-lived basal magma ocean can be beneficial to surface habitability, a long-lived basal magma ocean may sequester significant water in the mantle at the detriment of surface habitability. We find that magma oceans and deep-water cycling can maintain or recover habitable surface conditions on Earth-like planets at the inner edge of the habitable zone around late M-dwarf stars - these planets would otherwise be desiccated if they form with less than {\textasciitilde}10 terrestrial oceans of water.},

The small size of M dwarfs renders their planets exceptional targets for transmission spectroscopy, facilitating atmospheric characterization. However, it remains unknown whether their host stars' highly variable extreme-UV radiation environments allow atmospheres to persist. With JWST, we have begun to determine whether or not the most favorable rocky worlds orbiting M dwarfs have detectable atmospheres. Here, we present a 2.8-5.2 {$\mu$}m JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm (700 K, 40.3{\texttimes} Earth's insolation) super-Earth GJ 486b (1.3 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} and 3.0 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}). The measured spectrum from our two transits of GJ 486b deviates from a flat line at 2.2{$\sigma$} - 3.3{$\sigma$}, based on three independent reductions. Through a combination of forward and retrieval models, we determine that GJ 486b either has a water-rich atmosphere (with the most stringent constraint on the retrieved water abundance of H\textsubscript{2}O \&gt; 10\% to 2{$\sigma$}) or the transmission spectrum is contaminated by water present in cool unocculted starspots. We also find that the measured stellar spectrum is best fit by a stellar model with cool starspots and hot faculae. While both retrieval scenarios provide equal quality fits ( \$\{{\textbackslash}chi \}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}=1.0\$ ) to our NIRSpec/G395H observations, shorter wavelength observations can break this degeneracy and reveal if GJ 486b sustains a water-rich atmosphere.},

These planets are the smallest known planets that may have atmospheres amenable to detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We present model thermal emission and transmission spectra for each planet, varying composition and surface pressure of the atmosphere. We base elemental compositions on those of Earth, Titan, and Venus and calculate the molecular compositions assuming chemical equilibrium, which can strongly depend on temperature. Both thermal emission and transmission spectra are sensitive to the atmospheric composition; thermal emission spectra are sensitive to surface pressure and temperature. We predict the observability of each planet's atmosphere with JWST. GJ 1132b and TRAPPIST-1b are excellent targets for emission spectroscopy with JWST/MIRI, requiring fewer than 10 eclipse observations. Emission photometry for TRAPPIST-1c requires 5-15 eclipses; LHS 1140b and TRAPPIST-1d, TRAPPIST-1e, and TRAPPIST-1f, which could possibly have surface liquid water, may be accessible with photometry. Seven of the nine planets are strong candidates for transmission spectroscopy measurements with JWST, although the number of transits required depends strongly on the planets' actual masses. Using the measured masses, fewer than 20 transits are required for a 5{$\sigma$} detection of spectral features for GJ 1132b and six of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. Dedicated campaigns to measure the atmospheres of these nine planets will allow us, for the first time, to probe formation and evolution processes of terrestrial planetary atmospheres beyond our solar system.},

Observations of stellar Lyman-{$\alpha$} (Ly{$\alpha$}) absorption have suggested that the hot Jupiter HD 209458b is losing atomic hydrogen. We construct a model of escape that includes realistic heating and cooling, ionization balance, tidal gravity, and pressure confinement by the host star wind. We show that mass loss takes the form of a hydrodynamic (Parker) wind, emitted from the planet's dayside during lulls in the stellar wind. When dayside winds are suppressed by the confining action of the stellar wind, nightside winds might pick up if there is sufficient horizontal transport of heat. A hot Jupiter loses mass at maximum rates of {\textasciitilde}2 {\texttimes} 1012 g s-1 during its host star's pre-main-sequence phase and {\textasciitilde}2 {\texttimes} 1010 g s-1 during the star's main-sequence lifetime, for total maximum losses of {\textasciitilde}0.06\% and {\textasciitilde}0.6\% of the planet's mass, respectively. For UV fluxes F UV lsim 104 erg cm-2 s-1, the mass-loss rate is approximately energy limited and scales as {\textbackslash}dot\{M\} {$\propto$} F\_UV{\textasciicircum}\{0.9\}. For larger UV fluxes, such as those typical of T Tauri stars, radiative losses and plasma recombination force {\textbackslash}dot\{M\} to increase more slowly as F 0.6 UV. Dayside winds are quenched during the T Tauri phase because of confinement by overwhelming stellar wind pressure. During this early stage, nightside winds can still blow if the planet resides outside the stellar Alfv{\'e}n radius; otherwise, even nightside winds are stifled by stellar magnetic pressure, and mass loss is restricted to polar regions. We conclude that while UV radiation can indeed drive winds from hot Jupiters, such winds cannot significantly alter planetary masses during any evolutionary stage. They can, however, produce observable signatures. Candidates for explaining why the Lyman-{$\alpha$} photons of HD 209458 are absorbed at Doppler-shifted velocities of {\textpm}100 km s-1 include charge-exchange in the shock between the planetary and stellar winds.},

As one of those radiation limits, the outgoing infrared radiation has an asymptotic limit as the surface temperature increases. This is caused by the tropospheric structure approaching the water vapor saturation curve. It is considered that the asymptotic limits appearing in the radiatively and thermodynamically more complicated models utilized by Abe and Matsui (1988) and Kasting (1988) are corresponding to this asymptotic limit indicated in our model.},

As a long-term energy source for ongoing mantle melting and outgassing, tidal heating has been considered as a way to replenish lost atmospheres on rocky planets around active M-dwarfs. We simulate the early evolution of L 98-59 b, c and d using a time-evolved interior-atmosphere modelling framework, with a self-consistent implementation of tidal heating and redox-controlled outgassing. Emerging from our calculations is a novel self-limiting mechanism between radiative cooling, tidal heating, and mantle rheology, which we term the 'radiation-tide-rheology feedback'. Our coupled modelling yields self-limiting tidal heating estimates that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than previous calculations, and yet are still large enough to enable the extension of primordial magma oceans to Gyr timescales. Comparisons with a semi-analytic model demonstrate that this negative feedback is a robust mechanism which can probe a given planet's initial conditions, atmospheric composition, and interior structure. The orbit and instellation of the sub-Venus L 98-59 b likely place it in a regime where tidal heating has kept the planet molten up to the present day, even if it were to have lost its atmosphere. For c and d, a long-lived magma ocean can be induced by tides only with additional atmospheric regulation of energy transport.},

The MEarth Project, a future transit search, aims to employ a network of ground-based robotic telescopes to monitor M dwarfs in the northern hemisphere with sufficient precision and cadence to detect such planets. Here we investigate the design requirements for the MEarth Project. We evaluate the optimal bandpass, and the necessary field of view, telescope aperture, and telescope time allocation on a star-by-star basis, as is possible for the well-characterized nearby M dwarfs. Through these considerations, 1976 late M dwarfs (R {$<$} 0.33 R{$\odot$}) emerge as favorable targets for transit monitoring. Based on an observational cadence and on total telescope time allocation tailored to recover 90\% of transit signals from planets in habitable zone orbits, we find that a network of 10 30 cm telescopes could survey these 1976 M dwarfs in less than three years. A null result from this survey would set an upper limit (at 99\% confidence) of 17\% for the rate of occurrence of planets larger than 2 R{$\oplus$} in the habitable zones of late M dwarfs, and even stronger constraints for planets lying closer than the habitable zone. If the true occurrence rate of habitable planets is 10\%, the expected yield would be 2.6 planets.},

  abstract = {Understanding the physical characteristics of Venus, including its atmosphere, interior, and its evolutionary pathway with respect to Earth, remains a vital component for terrestrial planet evolution models and the emergence and/or decline of planetary habitability. A statistical strategy for evaluating the evolutionary pathways of terrestrial planets lies in the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets, where the sample size provides sufficient means for determining required runaway greenhouse conditions. Observations of potential exo-Venuses can help confirm hypotheses about Venus's past, as well as the occurrence rate of Venus-like planets in other systems. Additionally, the data from future Venus missions, such as DAVINCI, EnVision, and VERITAS, will provide valuable information regarding Venus, and the study of exo-Venuses will be complimentary to these missions. To facilitate studies of exo-Venus candidates, we provide a catalog of all confirmed terrestrial planets in the Venus zone, including transiting and nontransiting cases, and quantify their potential for follow-up observations. We examine the demographics of the exo-Venus population with relation to stellar and planetary properties, such as the planetary radius gap. We highlight specific high-priority exo-Venus targets for follow-up observations, including TOI-2285 b, LTT 1445 A c, TOI-1266 c, LHS 1140 c, and L98-59 d. We also discuss follow-up observations that may yield further insight into the Venus/Earth divergence in atmospheric properties.},

However, the amount of surface ice may be limited by considering the water condensed from the steam atmosphere in a runaway greenhouse state, and the physical mechanism for triggering the condensation process is not clear. Here, we use a two-column moist radiative-convective-subsiding model to investigate the water condensation process on tidally locked planets from the runaway greenhouse state. We find that the water condensation process is characterized by two distinct equilibrium states under the same \{incoming stellar flux\}. The initiation of condensation corresponds to a warm, unstable state exhibiting positive Planck feedback, whereas the termination phase corresponds to a cold, stable state exhibiting negative Planck feedback. We further show that the surface water mass in the collapsed state \{decreases with the\} incoming stellar flux, background surface pressure, and optical thickness of non-condensible greenhouse gases, with a global equivalent depth of less than \${\textbackslash}sim 20\$ cm. Our two-column approach provides a straightforward way to understand the water evolution on Venus zone planets around M dwarfs.},

The extreme irradiation levels that these atmospheres experience cause them to undergo hydrodynamic atmospheric escape. Ongoing atmospheric escape has been observed to be occurring in a few nearby exoplanet systems through transit spectroscopy both for hot Jupiters and for lower-mass super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Detailed hydrodynamic calculations that incorporate radiative transfer and ionization chemistry are now common in one-dimensional models, and multidimensional calculations that incorporate magnetic fields and interactions with the interstellar environment are cutting edge. However, comparison between simulations and observations remains very limited. While hot Jupiters experience atmospheric escape, the mass-loss rates are not high enough to affect their evolution. However, for lower-mass planets, atmospheric escape drives and controls their evolution, sculpting the exoplanet population that we observe today.},

  abstract = {A new piece of evidence supporting the photoevaporation-driven evolution model for low-mass, close-in exoplanets was recently presented by the California-Kepler Survey. The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is shown to be bimodal, with a ``valley'' separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}. Such an ``evaporation valley'' had been predicted by numerical models previously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley results from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the longest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only a few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes lighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for tenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the planet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation therefore herds planets into either bare cores ({$\sim$}1.3 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}), or those with double the core's radius ({$\sim$}2.6 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}). This process mostly occurs during the first 100 Myr when the stars' high-energy fluxes are high and nearly constant. The observed radius distribution further requires the Kepler planets to be clustered around 3 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} in mass, born with H/He envelopes more than a few percent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition. Such envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks, while the core composition indicates formation inside the ice line. Lastly, the photoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond {$\sim$}30-60 days; if these planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for planet formation, resembling the solar system terrestrial planets.},

We calculate evaporation rates by solving the hydrodynamical problem for planetary evaporation including heating from both X-ray and EUV radiation. We show that most close-in planets (a {$<$} 0.1 au) are evaporating hydrodynamically, with the evaporation occurring in two distinct regimes: X-ray driven, in which the X-ray heated flow contains a sonic point, and EUV driven, in which the X-ray region is entirely sub-sonic. The mass-loss rates scale as LX/a2 for X-ray driven evaporation, and as {$\Phi$}*1/2/a for EUV driven evaporation at early times, with mass-loss rates of the order of 1010-1014 g s-1. No exact scaling exists for the mass-loss rate with planet mass and planet radius; however, in general evaporation proceeds more rapidly for planets with lower densities and higher masses. Furthermore, we find that in general the transition from X-ray driven to EUV driven evaporation occurs at lower X-ray luminosities for planets closer to their parent stars and for planets with lower densities. Coupling our evaporation models to the evolution of the high-energy radiation - which falls with time - we are able to follow the evolution of evaporating planets. We find that most planets start off evaporating in the X-ray driven regime, but switch to EUV driven once the X-ray luminosity falls below a critical value. The evolution models suggest that while 'hot Jupiters' are evaporating, they are not evaporating at a rate sufficient to remove the entire gaseous envelope on Gyr time-scales. However, we do find that close in Neptune mass planets are more susceptible to complete evaporation of their envelopes. Thus we conclude that planetary evaporation is more important for lower mass planets, particularly those in the 'hot Neptune'/'super Earth' regime.},

Models for the bare-rock spectra of these planets often utilize a spectral library from R. Hu et al., which is based on room-temperature reflectance measurements of materials that represent archetypes of rocky planet surfaces. Here we present an expanded library that includes hemispherical reflectance measurements for a greater variety of compositions, varying textures (solid slab, coarsely crushed, and fine powder), as well as high-temperature (500--800 K) emissivity measurements for select samples. We incorporate this new library into version 6.3 of the open-source retrieval package PLATON and use it to show that planetary surfaces with similar compositions can have widely varying albedos and surface temperatures. We additionally demonstrate that changing the texture of a material can significantly alter its albedo, making albedo a poor proxy for surface composition. We identify key spectral features---the 5.6 {$\mu$}m olivine feature, the transparency feature, the Si-O stretching feature, and the Christiansen feature---that indicate silicate abundance and surface texture. We quantify the number of JWST observations needed to detect these features in the spectrum of the most favorable super-Earth target, LHS 3844 b, and revisit the interpretation of its Spitzer photometry. Lastly, we show that temperature-dependent changes in spectral features are likely undetectable at the precision of current exoplanet observations. Our results illustrate the importance of spectroscopically resolved thermal emission measurements, as distinct from surface albedo constraints, for characterizing the surface compositions of hot, rocky exoplanets.},

So far, emission observations of individual rocky exoplanets orbiting M stars (M-Earths) have not provided definitive evidence for atmospheres. Here, we synthesize emission data for M-Earths and find a trend in measured brightness temperatures (ratioed to its theoretical maximum value) as a function of instellation. However, the statistical evidence of this trend is dependent on the choice of stellar model and we consider its identification tentative. We show that this trend can be explained by either the onset of thin/tenuous (\&lt;1 bar) CO2-rich atmospheres on colder worlds, or a population of bare rocks with stronger space weathering and/or coarser regolith on closer-in worlds. Such grain coarsening may be caused by sintering near the melting point of rock or frequent volcanic resurfacing. Furthermore, we highlight considerations when testing rocky planet hypotheses at the population level, including the choice of instrument, stellar modeling, and how brightness temperatures are derived. We also find that fresh (unweathered) fine-grained surfaces can serve as a false positive to the detection of moderate atmospheric heat redistribution through eclipse observations. However, we argue that such surfaces are unlikely given the ubiquity of space weathering in the Solar System, the low albedo of Solar System airless bodies, and the high stellar wind environments of M-Earths. Emission data from a larger sample of M-Earths will be able to confirm or reject this tentative trend and diagnose its cause through spectral characterization.},

To resolve this ambiguity, we observed the LTT 1445 system for six spacecraft orbits of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using WFC3/UVIS imaging in spatial scan mode, including one partial transit of LTT 1445Ac. This imaging produces resolved light curves of each of the three stars in the LTT 1445 system. We confirm that the planet transits LTT 1445A and that LTT 1445C is the source of the rotational modulation seen in the TESS light curve, and we refine the estimate of the dilution factor for the TESS data. We perform a joint fit to the TESS and HST observations, finding that the transit of LTT 1445Ac is not grazing with 97\% confidence.

It is imperative that we understand where known planets sit relative to the cosmic shoreline, the boundary between planets that have retained atmospheres and those that have not. Previous works modeled the historic XUV radiation received by mid-to-late M-dwarf planets using a scaling relation calibrated using more massive stars, but fully convective M dwarfs display unique rotation/activity histories that differ from Sun-like stars and early M dwarfs. We synthesize observations of the active lifetimes of mid-to-late M dwarfs to present an updated estimate of their historic XUV fluence. For known planets of inactive, mid-to-late M dwarfs, we calculate a historic XUV fluence that is 2.1-3.1 times the canonical XUV scaling relation on average, with the larger value including corrections for the pre-main-sequence phase and energetic flares. We find that only the largest terrestrial planets known to orbit mid-to-late M-dwarfs are likely to have retained atmospheres within the cosmic shoreline paradigm. Our calculations may help to guide the selection of targets for JWST and may prove useful in interpreting the results; to this end, we define a novel Atmosphere Retention Metric (ARM) that indicates the distance between a planet and the cosmic shoreline, and tabulate the ARM for known mid-to-late M-dwarf planets.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the evolution of stellar extreme ultraviolet (EUV, 100-1000 {\AA}) emission is critical for assessing the evolution of planetary atmospheres and the habitability of M dwarf systems. Previous studies from the HAbitable Zones and M dwarf Activity across Time (HAZMAT) program showed the far- and near-UV (FUV, NUV) emission from M stars at various stages of a stellar lifetime through photometric measurements from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). The results revealed increased levels of short-wavelength emission that remain elevated for hundreds of millions of years. The trend for EUV flux as a function of age could not be determined empirically because absorption by the interstellar medium prevents access to the EUV wavelengths for the vast majority of stars. In this paper, we model the evolution of EUV flux from early M stars to address this observational gap. We present synthetic spectra spanning EUV to infrared wavelengths of 0.4 {\textpm} 0.05 M{$\odot$} stars at five distinct ages between 10 and 5000 Myr, computed with the PHOENIX atmosphere code and guided by the GALEX photometry. We model a range of EUV fluxes spanning two orders of magnitude, consistent with the observed spread in X-ray, FUV, and NUV flux at each epoch. Our results show that the stellar EUV emission from young M stars is 100 times stronger than field age M stars, and decreases as t-1 after remaining constant for a few hundred million years. This decline stems from changes in the chromospheric temperature structure, which steadily shifts outward with time. Our models reconstruct the full spectrally and temporally resolved history of an M star's UV radiation, including the unobservable EUV radiation, which drives planetary atmospheric escape, directly impacting a planet's potential for habitability.},

Colors for pre-MS stars match dwarf colors for some spectral types and colors, but for other spectral types and colors, deviations can exceed 0.3 mag. We estimate effective temperatures (Teff) and bolometric corrections (BCs) for our pre-MS star sample through comparing their photometry to synthetic photometry generated using the BT-Settl grid of model atmosphere spectra. We derive a new Teff and BC scale for pre-MS stars, which should be a more appropriate match for T Tauri stars than often-adopted dwarf star scales. While our new Teff scale for pre-MS stars is within 100 K of dwarfs at a given spectral type for stars},

With more than 3,500 exoplanets now known, the complexity of the discovery techniques, observations and physical characterisation have grown exponentially. This Handbook ties all these avenues of research together across a broad range of exoplanet science. Planet formation, exoplanet interiors and atmospheres, and habitability are discussed, providing in-depth coverage of our knowledge to date. Comprehensively updated from the first edition, it includes instrumental and observational developments, in-depth treatment of the new Kepler mission results and hot Jupiter atmospheric studies, and major updates on models of exoplanet formation. With extensive references to the research literature and appendices covering all individual exoplanet discoveries, it is a valuable reference to this exciting field for both incoming and established researchers.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

  abstract = {M-dwarf stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches because of their close proximity and favorable properties for both planet detection and characterization. However, the potential habitability and atmospheric characterization of these exoplanetary systems depends critically on the history of high-energy stellar radiation from X-rays to NUV, which drive atmospheric mass loss and photochemistry in the planetary atmospheres. With the Far Ultraviolet M-dwarf Evolution Survey, we have assessed the evolution of the FUV radiation, specifically eight prominent emission lines, including Ly{$\alpha$}, of M-dwarf stars with stellar rotation period and age. We demonstrate tight power-law correlations between the spectroscopic FUV features, and measure the intrinsic scatter of the quiescent FUV emissions. The luminosity evolution with rotation of these spectroscopic features is well-described by a broken power law, saturated for fast rotators, and decays with increasing Rossby number, with a typical power-law slope of -2, although likely shallower for Ly{$\alpha$}. Our regression fits enable FUV emission-line luminosity estimates relative to bolometric from known rotation periods to within {$\sim$}0.3 dex, across eight distinct UV emission lines, with possible trends in the fit parameters as a function of source layer in the stellar atmosphere. Our detailed analysis of the UV luminosity evolution with age further shows that habitable-zone planets orbiting lower-mass stars experience much greater high-energy radiative exposure relative the same planets orbiting more massive hosts. Around early- to mid-M dwarfs, these exoplanets, at field ages, accumulate up to 10-20{\texttimes} more EUV energy, relative to modern Earth. Moreover, the bulk of this UV exposure likely takes place within the first Gyr of the stellar lifetime. * This research is based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 526555.},

  abstract = {Accurate stellar properties are essential for precise stellar astrophysics and exoplanetary science. In the M-dwarf regime, much effort has gone into defining empirical relations that can use readily accessible observables to assess physical stellar properties. Often, these relations for the quantity of interest are cast as a nonlinear function of available data; in Bayesian modeling, however, the reverse is needed. In this article, we introduce a new Bayesian framework to self-consistently and simultaneously apply multiple empirical calibrations to fully characterize the mass, luminosity, radius, and effective temperature of a field age M dwarf. This framework includes a new M-dwarf mass-radius relation with a scatter of 3.1\% at fixed mass. We further introduce the M-dwarf Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Sample (MUSS), and apply our methodology to provide consistent stellar parameters for these nearby low-mass stars, selected as having available spectroscopic data in the ultraviolet. These targets are of interest largely as either exoplanet hosts or benchmarks in multiwavelength stellar activity. We use the field MUSS stars to define a low-mass main sequence in the solar neighborhood through Gaussian Process (GP) regression. These results enable us to empirically measure a feature in the GP derivative at \$\{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal M \}\}\_\{b\}=0.337\{{\textbackslash}pm \}\_\{0.026\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.013\}\$ M{$\odot$} that indicates where the MUSS transitions from fully to partly convective interiors.},

  abstract = {Planetary atmospheres have their birth in certain physical and chemical events in the primitive solar nebula. These events involve irreversible volatile retention through condensation and accretion of planetesimals and giant planets whose volatile inventory can survive the subsequent dissipation of the nebula. Clues to these earliest processes are inferred not without difficulty from the observed volatile compositions of present-day planetary and satellite atmospheres, meteorites and comets. The origins of terrestrial-type atmospheres appear to have involved outgassing of the solid planet with compositions and rates intimately connected to the late growth and thermal evolution of the planet itself. Subsequent evolutionary processes such as escape of certain light elements and cometary and meteoritic infall appear to be of general significance; others such as atmosphere- hydrosphere-crust interactions and development and influence of living organisms are highly specific. Our knowledge of these highly specific areas is largely restricted to the last 3.8 billion years on earth and is based upon analyses of the geologic record which are not presently available for Venus, Titan or the pre-Archean earth and are only available in a superficial way for Mars. In this introductory paper we attempt to draw an integrated picture of the atmospheric evolutionary process being careful to define the outstanding problems, to differentiate theory from fact, and to emphasize the strengths and weaknesses of apriori and aposteriori approaches to these problems.},

  abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy is still the preferred characterization technique for exoplanet atmospheres, although it presents unique challenges that translate into characterization bottlenecks when robust mitigation strategies are missing. Stellar contamination is one such challenge that can overpower the planetary signal by up to an order of magnitude, and thus not accounting for it can lead to significant biases in the derived atmospheric properties. Yet this accounting may not be straightforward, as important discrepancies exist between state-of-the-art stellar models and measured spectra and between models themselves. Here we explore the extent to which stellar models can be used to reliably correct for stellar contamination and yield a planet's uncontaminated transmission spectrum. We find that discrepancies between stellar models can significantly contribute to the noise budget of JWST transmission spectra of planets around stars with heterogeneous photospheres, the true number of unique photospheric spectral components and their properties can only be accurately retrieved when the stellar models have sufficient fidelity, and under such optimistic circumstances the contribution of stellar contamination to the noise budget of a transmission spectrum is considerably below that of the photon noise for the standard transit observation setup. Therefore, we advocate for further development of model spectra of stars and their active regions in a data-driven manner, empirical approaches for deriving spectra of photospheric components using the observatories with which the atmospheric explorations are carried out, and analysis techniques accounting for multimodal posterior distributions for photospheric parameters of interest, which will be increasingly revealed by precise JWST measurements.},

  abstract = {Attempts to probe the atmospheres of rocky planets around M dwarfs present both promise and peril. While their favorable planet-to-star radius ratios enable searches for even thin secondary atmospheres, their high activity levels and high-energy outputs threaten atmosphere survival. Here we present the 0.6--2.85 {$\mu$}m transmission spectrum of the 1.1 R\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}, {$\sim$} 340 K rocky planet TRAPPIST-1 c obtained over two JWST NIRISS/SOSS transit observations. Each of the two spectra displays 100--500 ppm signatures of stellar contamination. Despite being separated by 367 days, the retrieved spot and facula properties are consistent between the two visits, resulting in nearly identical transmission spectra. Jointly retrieving for stellar contamination and a planetary atmosphere reveals that our spectrum can rule out hydrogen-dominated, {$\lessequivlnt$}300{\texttimes} solar metallicity atmospheres with effective surface pressures down to 10 mbar at the 3{$\sigma$} level. For high mean molecular weight atmospheres, where O\textsubscript{2} or N\textsubscript{2} is the background gas, our spectrum disfavors partial pressures of more than {$\sim$}10 mbar for H\textsubscript{2}O, CO, NH\textsubscript{3}, and CH\textsubscript{4} at the 2{$\sigma$} level. Similarly, under the assumption of a 100\% H\textsubscript{2}O, NH\textsubscript{3}, CO, or CH\textsubscript{4} atmosphere, our spectrum disfavors thick, \&gt;1-bar atmospheres at the 2{$\sigma$} level. These nondetections of spectral features are in line with predictions that even heavier, CO\textsubscript{2}-rich atmospheres would be efficiently lost on TRAPPIST-1 c given the cumulative high-energy irradiation experienced by the planet. Our results further stress the importance of robustly accounting for stellar contamination when analyzing JWST observations of exo-Earths around M dwarfs, as well as the need for high-fidelity stellar models to search for the potential signals of thin secondary atmospheres.},

  abstract = {Stellar surface heterogeneities, such as spots and faculae, often contaminate exoplanet transit spectra, hindering precise atmospheric characterization. We demonstrate a novel, epoch-based, model-independent method to mitigate stellar contamination, applicable to multiplanet systems with at least one airless planet. We apply this method using quasi-simultaneous transits of TRAPPIST-1 b and TRAPPIST-1 c observed on 2024 July 9, with JWST/NIRSpec PRISM. These two planets, with nearly identical radii and impact parameters, are likely to either be bare rocks or possess thin, low-pressure atmospheres, making them ideal candidates for this technique, as variations in their transit spectra would be primarily attributed to stellar activity. Our observations reveal their transit spectra exhibit consistent features, indicating similar levels of stellar contamination. We use TRAPPIST-1 b to correct the transit spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 c, achieving a 2.5 {\texttimes} reduction in stellar contamination at shorter wavelengths. At longer wavelengths, lower signal-to-noise ratio prevents clear detection of contamination or full assessment of mitigation. Still, out-of-transit analysis reveals variations across the spectrum, suggesting contamination extends into the longer wavelengths. Based on the success of the correction at shorter wavelengths, we argue that contamination is also reduced at longer wavelengths to a similar extent. This shifts the challenge of detecting atmospheric features to a predominantly white noise issue, which can be addressed by stacking observations. This method enables epoch-specific stellar contamination corrections, allowing coaddition of planetary spectra for reliable searches of secondary atmospheres with signals of 60--250 ppm. Additionally, we identify small-scale cold ({$\sim$}2000 K) and warm ({$\sim$}2600 K) regions almost uniformly distributed on TRAPPIST-1, with overall covering fractions varying by {$\sim$}0.1\% per hour.},

We were charged with identifying key science themes, providing recommendations on issues associated with optimal timing and scale of resources, as well as providing a recommended DDT concept achievable with 500 hours of JWST time. We recommend a DDT concept to survey the atmospheres of rocky-M dwarf exoplanets. It is critical to quickly survey a wide sample of such targets to ascertain if they indeed host significant atmospheres, i.e., define the cosmic shoreline, and to identify high priority targets for future follow-up. It is important for this effort to occur early in the mission lifetime. In the context of strategic planning of exoplanet observations, it is useful to estimate the expected exoplanet observational commitment over JWST's lifetime. Given the current usage associated with exoplanets, extended over 20 cycles, it is anticipated that JWST will dedicate \${\textbackslash}approx\$30,000 hours to exoplanet observations. We recommend efforts to support GO-driven programs that will contribute to this unprecedented data product of JWST. Of the \${\textbackslash}approx\$30,000 hours of anticipated JWST full-mission time dedicated to exoplanets, we expect that 1/3 of it could, and perhaps inevitably would, form a comprehensive, high S/N, panchromatic, 10\${\textasciicircum}4\$ hour atmospheric survey of planets. Such an observational sample would be a legacy archive that would address a broad range of science questions across various populations of planets. It would also bridge the direct imaging and transit communities and involve a multitude of techniques to detect and characterize exoplanets.},

The chief science goals are to study the solar magnetic dynamo and to determine the radiative and magnetic properties of the Sun during its evolution across the main sequence. The present paper focuses on the latter goal, which has the ultimate purpose of providing the spectral irradiance evolution of solar-type stars to be used in the study and modeling of planetary atmospheres. The results from the Sun in Time program suggest that the coronal X-ray-EUV emissions of the young main-sequence Sun were {\textasciitilde}100-1000 times stronger than those of the present Sun. Similarly, the transition region and chromospheric FUV-UV emissions of the young Sun are expected to be 20-60 and 10-20 times stronger, respectively, than at present. When we consider the integrated high-energy emission from 1 to 1200 {\AA}, the resulting relationship indicates that about 2.5 Gyr ago the solar high-energy flux was about 2.5 times the present value and about 3.5 Gyr ago was about 6 times the present value (when life supposedly arose on Earth). The strong radiation emissions inferred should have had major influences on the thermal structure, photochemistry, and photoionization of planetary atmospheres and have played an important role in the development of primitive life in the solar system. Some examples of the application of the Sun in Time results on exoplanets and on early solar system planets are discussed.},

  abstract = {Knowing the high-energy radiation environment of a star over a planet's formation and evolutionary period is critical in determining if that planet is potentially habitable and if any biosignatures could be detected, as UV radiation can severely change or destroy a planet's atmosphere. Current efforts for finding a potentially habitable planet are focused on M stars, yet K stars may offer more habitable conditions due to decreased stellar activity and more distant and wider habitable zones (HZs). While M star activity evolution has been observed photometrically and spectroscopically, there has been no dedicated investigation of K star UV evolution. We present the first comprehensive study of the near-UV, far-UV, and X-ray evolution of K stars. We used members of young moving groups and clusters ranging in age from 10 to 625 Myr combined with field stars and their archived GALEX UV and ROSAT X-ray data to determine how the UV and X-ray radiation evolve. We find that the UV and X-ray flux incident on an HZ planet is 5-50 times lower than that of HZ planets around early-M stars and 50-1000 times lower than those around late-M stars, due to both an intrinsic decrease in K dwarf stellar activity occurring earlier than for M dwarfs and the more distant location of the K dwarf HZ.},

  abstract = {The terrestrial planets are believed to have formed by accretion from an initially cold and chemically homogeneous cloud of dust and gas. The iron occurring in the dust particles of the cloud was present in a completely oxidised form. Either before or during accretion of dust into planets, partial reduction of oxidised iron to metal occurred. The role of oxidationreduction equilibria during the formation of terrestrial planets is discussed and it is concluded that the differing zero-pressure densities of the planets are caused dominantly by differing mean states of oxidation which were established during the primary accretion processes. This interpretation avoids the necessity for assuming the occurrence of physical fractionation of metal from silicates in the solar nebula before accretion. A detailed study is made of the evidence shed by chondritic meteorites upon oxidationreduction equilibria occurring early in the history of the solar system. The significance of the widely varying oxidation states of chrondrites is discussed. It is concluded that the different classes of chondrites have formed by an autoreduction process operating upon primitive material similar in composition to the Type I carbonaceous chondrites. Reduction occurred when this material accreted into parent bodies which were heated internally, perhaps by extinct radioactivities. Under these conditions, trapped carbonaceous material reacted with oxidised iron to produce a metallic phase in situ. Such a process explains the primary oxidation-reduction relationships in chondrites established by PRIOR. The chemistry of the reduction process which operated in chondrites is studied. The evidence strongly indicates that the principal reducing agent was carbon and not hydrogen. Furthermore, reduction occurred in a condensed environment and not in the dispersed solar nebula. The origins and chemical evolution of other terrestrial planets are discussed in the light of evidence yielded by the chondrites. The hypothesis is advanced that each of the terrestrial planets formed by a single-stage autoreduction process operating upon primitive material similar to the Type 1 carbonaceous chondrites. In the case of the earth, autoreduction occurred at higher mean temperatures than in chondrites because of the large gravitational energy source which was involved. Accordingly, it is suggested that selective volatility played a more important part than in chondrites, and that many relatively volatile elements were lost from the earth. On the other hand the earth may have retained essentially the primordial abundances of elements which are not readily volatile under high-temperature, reducing conditions. A detailed study of the earth's chemical composition supports this hypothesis. It is possible to construct a self consistent model from the primordial abundances of elements which are not readily volatile under high-temperature reducing conditions. The model implies the presence of silicon as an important component of the earth's core. Independent evidence supporting this implication is cited. The distribution and fractionation of oxyphile non-volatile elements imply that much or all of the mantle has been subjected to complete or partial melting at some stage in its history. In contrast to the non-volatile elements, it appears that the earth has suffered strong depletion in a large number of volatile elements - Na, K, Rb, Cs, Zn, Cd, Hg, Bi, Tl, Pb, Cl, S and many others. It is suggested that loss of these elements by volatilization occurred during the primary accretion of the earth from primitive oxidised material, and that reduction, complete melting, formation of the core, and fractionation of the mantle occurred during and immediately after the primary accretion process. Studies of the abundance of siderophile elements in the mantle, of the mean oxidation state of the mantle and of the nature of the volatile components which have been degassed from the mantle show that the mantle is not and never has been in equilibrium with the core. This conclusion places an important constraint on the core-formation process. It is shown to be incompatible with the currently accepted theory that the material from which the earth accreted was composed of an intimate mixture of silicate and metal particles similar to ordinary chondrites. The formation of the earth by direct accretion and autoreduction of primitive material resulted in the generation of an enormous primitive atmosphere composed principally of CO and H \textsubscript{2}, together with the volatile elements mentioned above. It is suggested that this atmosphere subsequently escaped from the earth carrying the volatile elements mentioned above. Possible mechanisms of escape are discussed. In the terminal phase of accretion, the temperature was sufficiently high to reduce and volatilise magnesium and silicon monoxide from the infalling planetesimals and dust. At this stage, the condensed matter accreting on the earth consisted principally of metallic iron and calcium and aluminum silicates. When the primitive atmosphere was disrupted and escaped, the accompanying expansion and cooling caused precipitation of the non-volatile silicate components of the atmosphere in the form of planetesimals and smoke. Precipitation of this material, mainly as iron-poor magnesian silicates occurred in a sediment-ring around the earth. This material became mixed with primitive planetesimals possessing the composition of Type 1 carbonaceous chondrites, which had not accreted upon the earth. The sediment-ring of highly reduced magnesian silicate planetesimals and primitive oxidised planetesimals became unstable and coagulated to form the moon. The properties of the moon are discussed in terms of its formation from such material. Possible explanations of the moon's density, luminescent properties, surface heterogeniety, thermal history and stress history emerge. A possibility that stoney meteorites are derived from the moon is also discussed. It is distinctly possible that ordinary chondrites may have formed by autoreduction and fractionation which occurred when primitive Type I carbonaceous chondrite planetesimals collided with the moon during its terminal period of formation. Other theories of lunar origin are briefly reviewed. The origins and internal constitution of the other terrestrial planets are discussed. Mercury is believed to have accreted from the solar nebula at an initially high temperature, maintained by an early stage of high solar luminosity. As a result, Mercury suffered depletion of magnesian silicates which were reduced and volatilised under these conditions. The abundance of iron, which was not volatilised was correspondingly increased, resulting in a high mean density for this planet. The evolution of Venus was very similar to that of the earth. Its mean state of oxidation may be slightly higher. The material from which Venus accreted possessed a higher C/H ratio than the source material of the earth. Differing atmospheric compositions are attributable to this factor. Mars is composed of highly oxidised primordial material, with little or no metal phase. Lack of reduction is attributed to the small content of carbonaceous material in the primordial material from which Mars accreted. Physical properties and the thermal history of Mars are discussed in terms of the proposed chemical constitution and the possibility of a self consistent solution is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The primary epoch of planetary accretion concludes with giant impacts - highly energetic collisions between proto-planets that can play a key role in shaping a planet's inventory of volatile elements. Previous work has shown that single giant impacts have the potential to eject a significant amount of a planet's atmosphere but that the efficiency of atmospheric loss depends strongly on the impact parameters and atmospheric properties. Fully quantifying the role of giant impacts in planetary volatile evolution requires a more complete understanding of the mechanisms driving loss during impacts. Here, we use a suite of 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to show that loss in giant impacts is controlled primarily by ejecta plumes near the impact site and breakout of the impact shock in the far field, with the efficiency of the latter well approximated by 1D ground-kick calculations. The relative contributions of each mechanism to loss changes drastically with varying impact parameters. By considering the near and far field separately, we present a scaling law that precisely approximates (to within an average of \${\textbackslash}sim\$3\%) loss from 0.35 to 5.0 Earth mass planets with 5\% mass fraction H\$\_2\$-He atmospheres for any combination of impactor mass, impact velocity, and angle. Finally, we apply our scaling law to the results of \$N\$-body simulations for different solar system formation scenarios. We find that while individual impacts rarely cause significant loss (\$\&gt;\$10\%) from roughly Earth-mass planets with such massive primary atmospheres, the cumulative effect of multiple impacts can be substantial (40-70\% loss).},

Recently, transit photometry was used to discover seven planets orbiting the late-M dwarf TRAPPIST-1. Three of TRAPPIST-1's planets fall in the Habitable Zone, a region where liquid water could exist on the planetary surface given appropriate planetary conditions. We aim to investigate the habitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets by studying the star's activity and its effect on the planets. We analyze previously published space- and ground-based light curves and show the photometrically determined rotation period of TRAPPIST-1 appears to vary over time due to complicated, evolving surface activity. The dramatic changes of the surface of TRAPPIST-1 suggest that rotation periods determined photometrically may not be reliable for this and similarly active stars. While the activity of the star is low, we use the premise of the ``cosmic shoreline'' to provide evidence that the TRAPPIST-1 environment has potentially led to the erosion of possible planetary atmospheres by extreme ultraviolet stellar emission.},

The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have RV mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck RV follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than {$\sim$}50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of 1.6 \{\{R\}\vphantom\}\textsubscript{{\textbackslash}oplus }\vphantom\{\} planets have too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of ``Earth-like'' planets, \{\{{$\eta$} \}\vphantom\}\textsubscript{{\textbackslash}oplus }\vphantom\{\}.},

We use X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton of seven of these targets to derive the high-energy irradiation level of the planetary atmospheres and the resulting mass loss rates. We further derive improved Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity estimates for the host stars including interstellar absorption.

The unusually short orbital period and the relative brightness of the host star (m Kep = 11.5) enable robust detections of the changing illumination of the visible hemisphere of the planet, as well as the occultations of the planet by the star. We interpret these signals as representing a combination of reflected and reprocessed light, with the highest planet dayside temperature in the range of 2300 K-3100 K.

We find that the existence of this new class of volatile-rich objects, the lack of volatiles on most Kuiper Belt objects, and even the otherwise peculiar surface of 2005 FY9 can be explained as a consequence of atmospheric escape of volatile compounds. While previous studies of the surface compositions of objects in the Kuiper Belt have found no explainable patterns, atmospheric escape appears to provide a first-order explanation of the range of surface spectra seen on bodies in the outer solar system.},

Recent research in this burgeoning field has made it possible to observe and measure the atmospheres of these exoplanets. This is the first textbook to describe the basic physical processes--including radiative transfer, molecular absorption, and chemical processes--common to all planetary atmospheres, as well as the transit, eclipse, and thermal phase variation observations that are unique to exoplanets. In each chapter, Sara Seager offers a conceptual introduction, examples that combine the relevant physics equations with real data, and exercises. Topics range from foundational knowledge, such as the origin of atmospheric composition and planetary spectra, to more advanced concepts, such as solutions to the radiative transfer equation, polarization, and molecular and condensate opacities. Since planets vary widely in their atmospheric properties, Seager emphasizes the major physical processes that govern all planetary atmospheres. Moving from first principles to cutting-edge research, Exoplanet Atmospheres is an ideal resource for students and researchers in astronomy and earth sciences, one that will help prepare them for the next generation of planetary science.},

  abstract = {This is a unique time in human history - for the first time, we are on the technological brink of being able to answer questions that have been around for thousands of years: Are there other planets like Earth? Are they common? Do any have signs of life? The field of exoplanets is rapidly moving toward answering these questions with the discovery of hundreds of exoplanets now pushing toward lower and lower masses; the Kepler Space Telescope with its yield of small planets; plans to use the James Webb Space Telescope (launch date 2014) to study atmospheres of a subset of super Earths; and ongoing development for technology to directly image true Earth analogs. Theoretical studies in dynamics, planet formation, and physical characteristics provide the needed framework for prediction and interpretation. People working outside of exoplanets often ask if the field of exoplanets is like a dot.com bubble that will burst, deflating excitement and progress. In my opinion, exciting discoveries and theoretical advances will continue indefinitely in the years ahead, albeit at a slower pace than in the first decade. The reason is that observations uncover new kinds and new populations of exoplanets -- and these observations rely on technological development that usually takes over a decade to mature. For example, in the early 2000s all but one exoplanet was discovered by the radial velocity technique. At that time, many groups around the world were working on wide-field transit surveys. But it was not until recently, a decade into the twenty-first century, that the transit technique is responsible for almost one-quarter of known exoplanets. The planet discovery techniques astrometry (as yet to find a planet) and direct imaging have not yet matured; when they do, they will uncover planets within a new parameter space of planet mass and orbital characteristics. In addition, people are working hard to improve the precision for existing planet discovery techniques to detect lower-mass planets and those further from the star. All in all, technology enables slow but sure progress, and this fuels ongoing discovery. Theory, like observations, also takes time to unfold and mature. We can anticipate an "ultimate" planet formation model similar to the "millenimum simulation" for galaxy formation and evolution. In time, incorporating detailed physics as well as being able to reproduce the generic outcome of planet populations (mass, radius, and orbital characteristics, including period) will enable a deeper understanding of planet formation and migration. Similarly, the ideal exoplanet atmosphere code of the future could be a three-dimensional Monte Carlo code that includes radiative transfer with inhomogeneous cloud coverage and surface features, a code that also solves for the temperature structure and combines with a hydrodynamical simulation to calculate the three-dimensional temperature and wind structure. Classical orbital mechanics, already reinvigorated by interesting exoplanet systems (e.g., planets in resonant orbits, hot Jupiter exoplanets that orbit in the direction opposite to the stellar rotation), also has a role to play in explaining fundamental mechanisms of how planetary system configurations came to be. Orbital dynamics modeling is driving the search for moons and other unseen planet companions by their perturbations on transiting planet signatures. Exoplanets is a unique science because it involves so many disciplines within and beyond planetary science and astrophysics. The other disciplines include geophysics, high-pressure mineral physics, quantum mechanics, chemistry, and even microbiology. While exoplanet observations clearly belong under the branch of astronomy, for many years the whole discipline of exoplanets lacked a true home. Physics departments have said "Exoplanets: It's interesting, but is it physics?" Planetary and Earth science departments used to collecting real data in their hands from Earth and in situ measurements from solar system planets were, in the early 2000s, reluctant to believe there would ever be enough high-quality data to take the research field of exoplanets seriously. With hundreds of known exoplanets and many fascinating observational and theoretical discoveries, the whole world is embracing exoplanets, a field that can now find its home both in and spanning across planetary science, astronomy and astrophysics, and astrobiology. We use the term "exoplanets" and not "extrasolar planets" in this book. Exoplanets is the most direct derivative from the Greek language, from which the word "planet" originates. (Note that the word "extrasolar" is derived from Latin.) It is most fitting that the field be named as traditionally as possible, and there is none more traditional than Greek. The goal of this volume is to cover the range of topics in exoplanet observation and theory at the graduate student level. Each chapter of this volume aims to cover the fundamentals and recent discoveries in such a way as to be a cross between a textbook and a review article. Because the field of exoplanets moves so rapidly, we have tried to arrange each chapter so that the first two sections (the introduction and and an explanation of the basic concepts/fundamental equations) will not go out of date. The next two sections (covering recent highlights and future progress) will go out of date eventually, but serve to capture and review what is going on in a subfield. Some chapters deviate from the standard structure and, by nature of construction, the level of technical detail and writing style will vary in an edited volume with different authors for each chapter. We intend that this book will serve to inspire professional researchers and engineers and students to build a foundation for the next generation of exoplanet observational and theoretical discoveries. Exoplanets is the 37th book in the University of Arizona Press Space Science Series, the first dedicated to planets beyond our solar system. As editor of this volume, I foremost thank General Editor Richard Binzel for believing in my vision for this book and for his advice and fast turnaround on practical matters. I am extremely grateful to Ren{\'e}e Dotson of the Lunar and Planetary Institute for her patience and careful efforts in compiling and production of the book. The book would not have been possible without the contribution and dedication of each of the chapter authors, often going far beyond what the authors had initially anticipated. The chapter reviewers played an invaluable role in improving the quality of this book. Appreciation to William Hartmann for his original painting that graces the book's cover. Last but not least, I am grateful to Wes Traub of NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory for his financial support, which has enabled the book to be available for a practical purchase price. Close to two decades since the first exoplanets were discovered, the field of exoplanets has grown without bound. So many surprising discoveries have been made that by now we know to expect the unexpected. I always like to say that, for exoplanets, anything is possible within the laws of physics and chemistry. And, when asked about which planet or discovery is my favorite one, I like to reply that it is the next one, because in exoplanets, the best is yet to come. I hope you, the reader, will use this book to learn about whichever subdiscipline interests you and to build your knowledge to play a role in the future of exoplanet research.},

We suppose that the H 2 and He escaped from the Earth, owing to the effects of strong solar wind and EUV radiation, in stages after the solar nebula itself dissipated into the outer space. The primordial atmosphere also contained the rare gases Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe whose amounts were much greater than those contained in the present Earth's atmosphere. Thus, we have studied in this paper the dissipation of these rare gases due to the drag effect of outflowing hydrogen molecules. By means of the two-component gas kinetic theory and under the assumption of spherically symmetric flow, we have found that the outflow velocity of each rare gas relative to that of hydrogen is expressed in terms of only two parameters --- the rate of hydrogen mass flow across the spherical surface under consideration and the temperature at this surface. According to this result, the rare gases were dissipated below the levels of their contents in the present atmosphere, when the mass loss rate of hydrogen was much greater than 1 {\texttimes} 10 17 g/yr throughout the stages where the atmospheric mass decreased from 1 {\texttimes} 10 26 g to 4 {\texttimes} 10 19 g.},

  abstract = {Tidal heating on Io due to its finite eccentricity was predicted to drive surface volcanic activity, which was subsequently confirmed by the Voyager spacecraft. Although the volcanic activity in Io is more complex, in theory volcanism can be driven by runaway melting in which the tidal heating increases as the mantle thickness decreases. We show that this runaway melting mechanism is generic for a composite planetary body with liquid core and solid mantle, provided that (i) the mantle rigidity, {$\mu$}, is comparable to the central pressure, i.e., {$\mu$}/({$\rho$} gR \textsubscript{P}) {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.1 for a body with density {$\rho$}, surface gravitational acceleration g, and radius R \textsubscript{P}; (ii) the surface is not molten; (iii) tides deposit sufficient energy; and (iv) the planet has nonzero eccentricity. We calculate the approximate liquid core radius as a function of {$\mu$}/({$\rho$} gR \textsubscript{P}), and find that more than 90\% of the core will melt due to this runaway for {$\mu$}/({$\rho$} gR \textsubscript{P}) {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1. From all currently confirmed exoplanets, we find that the terrestrial planets in the L 98-59 system are the most promising candidates for sustaining active volcanism. However, uncertainties regarding the quality factors and the details of tidal heating and cooling mechanisms prohibit definitive claims of volcanism on any of these planets. We generate synthetic transmission spectra of these planets assuming Venus-like atmospheric compositions with an additional 5\%, 50\%, and 98\% SO\textsubscript{2} component, which is a tracer of volcanic activity. We find a {$\greaterequivlnt$}3{$\sigma$} preference for a model with SO\textsubscript{2} with 5-10 transits with JWST for L 98-59bcd.},

  abstract = {We present the results of our work to determine the average albedo for small, close-in planets in the Kepler candidate catalog. We have adapted our method of averaging short-cadence light curves of multiple Kepler planet candidates to long-cadence data, in order to detect an average albedo for the group of candidates. Long-cadence data exist for many more candidates than the short-cadence data, and so we separate the candidates into smaller radius bins than in our previous work: 1-2 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus , 2-4 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus , and 4-6 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus . We find that, on average, all three groups appear darker than suggested by the short-cadence results, but not as dark as many hot Jupiters. The average geometric albedos for the three groups are 0.11 {\textpm} 0.06, 0.05 {\textpm} 0.04, and 0.23 {\textpm} 0.11, respectively, for the case where heat is uniformly distributed about the planet. If heat redistribution is inefficient, the albedos are even lower, since there will be a greater thermal contribution to the total light from the planet. We confirm that newly identified false-positive Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) 1662.01 is indeed an eclipsing binary at twice the period listed in the planet candidate catalog. We also newly identify planet candidate KOI 4351.01 as an eclipsing binary, and we report a secondary eclipse measurement for Kepler-4b (KOI 7.01) of {$\sim$}7.50 ppm at a phase of {$\sim$}0.7, indicating that the planet is on an eccentric orbit.},

  abstract = {Planetary climate can be affected by the interaction of the host star spectral energy distribution with the wavelength-dependent reflectivity of ice and snow. Here we explore this effect using a one dimensional (1-D), line-by-line, radiative-transfer model to calculate broadband planetary albedos as input to a seasonally varying, 1-D energy-balance climate model. A three-dimensional general circulation model is also used to explore the atmosphere's response to changes in incoming stellar radiation, or instellation, and surface albedo. Using this hierarchy of models we simulate planets covered by ocean, land, and water ice of varying grain size, with incident radiation from stars of different spectral types. Terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibit a stronger ice-albedo feedback. We find that ice-covered conditions occur on an F-dwarf planet with only a 2\% reduction in instellation relative to the present instellation on Earth, assuming fixed CO2 (present atmospheric level on Earth). A similar planet orbiting the Sun at an equivalent flux distance requires an 8\% reduction in instellation, while a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star requires an additional 19\% reduction in instellation to become ice-covered, equivalent to 73\% of the modern solar constant. The surface ice-albedo feedback effect becomes less important at the outer edge of the habitable zone, where atmospheric CO2 can be expected to be high in order to maintain clement conditions for surface liquid water. We show that 3-10 bars of CO2 will entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow, leaving the outer limits of the habitable zone unaffected by the spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. However, less CO2 is needed to maintain open water for a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star, than would be the case for hotter main-sequence stars.},

  abstract = {The spectral energy distribution, variability, and evolution of the high-energy radiation from an M dwarf planet host is crucial in understanding the planet's atmospheric evolution and habitability and in interpreting the planet's spectrum. The star's extreme-UV (EUV), far-UV (FUV), and near-UV (NUV) emission can chemically modify, ionize, and erode the atmosphere over time. This makes determining the lifetime exposure of such planets to stellar UV radiation critical for both the evolution of a planet's atmosphere and our potential to characterize it. Using the early M star members of nearby young moving groups, which sample critical ages in planet formation and evolution, we measure the evolution of the GALEX NUV and FUV flux as a function of age. The median UV flux remains at a "saturated" level for a few hundred million years, analogous to that observed for X-ray emission. By the age of the Hyades Cluster (650 Myr), we measure a drop in UV flux by a factor of 2-3 followed by a steep drop from old (several Gyrs) field stars. This decline in activity beyond 300 Myr follows roughly t -1. Despite this clear evolution, there remains a wide range, of 1-2 orders of magnitude, in observed emission levels at every age. These UV data supply the much-needed constraints to M dwarf upper-atmosphere models, which will provide empirically motivated EUV predictions and more accurate age-dependent UV spectra as inputs to planetary photochemical models.

To within the error bars, this is identical to the pressure derived from the previous occultation of 5 October 2017, p\textsubscript{1400} = 1.18 {\textpm} 0.03 {$\mu$}bar and p\textsubscript{surf} = 14.1 {\textpm} 0.4 {$\mu$}bar, respectively. Based on recent models of the volatile cycles of Triton, the overall evolution of the surface pressure over the last 30 years is consistent with N\textsubscript{2} condensation taking place in the northern hemisphere. However, models typically predict a steady decrease in the surface pressure for the period 2005-2060, which is not confirmed by this observation. Complex surface-atmosphere interactions, such as ice albedo runaway and formation of local N\textsubscript{2} frosts in the equatorial regions of Triton, could explain the relatively constant pressure between 2017 and 2022.},

Methods: We first selected 16 Kepler and K2 USP sub-Neptunes based on the expected occultation signal. We filtered out stellar variability in the Kepler light curves, using a sliding linear fitting and, when required, a more sophisticated approach based on a Gaussian process regression. In the case of the detection of secondary eclipse or phase variation with a confidence level higher than 2{$\sigma$}, we simultaneously modeled the primary transit, secondary eclipse, and phase variations in a Bayesian framework, by using information from previous studies and knowledge of the Gaia parallaxes. We further derived constraints on the geometric albedo as a function of the planet's brightness temperature. Results: We confirm the optical secondary eclipses for Kepler-10b (13{$\sigma$}), Kepler-78b (9.5{$\sigma$}), and K2-141b (6.9{$\sigma$}), with marginal evidence for K2-312b (2.2{$\sigma$}). We report new detections for K2-106b (3.3{$\sigma$}), K2-131b (3.2{$\sigma$}), Kepler-407b (3.0{$\sigma$}), and hints for K2-229b (2.5{$\sigma$}). For all targets, with the exception of K2-229b and K2-312b, we also find phase curve variations with a confidence level higher than 2{$\sigma$}. Conclusions: Two USP planets, namely Kepler-10b and Kepler-78b, show non-negligible nightside emission. This questions the scenario of magma-ocean worlds with inefficient heat redistribution to the nightside for both planets. Due to the youth of the Kepler-78 system and the small planetary orbital separation, the planet may still retain a collisional secondary atmosphere capable of conducting heat from the day to the nightside. Instead, the presence of an outgassing magma ocean on the dayside and the low high-energy irradiation of the old host star may have enabled Kepler-10b to build up and retain a recently formed collisional secondary atmosphere. The magma-world scenario may instead apply to K2-141b and K2-131b.},

  abstract = {Voyager 2 images of Neptune reveal a windy planet characterized by bright clouds of methane ice suspended in an exceptionally clear atmosphere above a lower deck of hydrogen sulfide or ammonia ices. Neptune's atmosphere is dominated by a large anticyclonic storm system that has been named the Great Dark Spot (GDS). About the same size as Earth in extent, the GDS bears both many similarities and some differences to the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Neptune's zonal wind profile is remarkably similar to that of Uranus. Neptune has three major rings at radii of 42,000, 53,000, and 63,000 kilometers. The outer ring contains three higher density arc-like segments that were apparently responsible for most of the ground-based occultation events observed during the current decade. Like the rings of Uranus, the Neptune rings are composed of very dark material; unlike that of Uranus, the Neptune system is very dusty. Six new regular satellites were found, with dark surfaces and radii ranging from 200 to 25 kilometers. All lie inside the orbit of Triton and the inner four are located within the ring system. Triton is seen to be a differentiated body, with a radius of 1350 kilometers and a density of 2.1 grams per cubic centimeter; it exhibits clear evidence of early episodes of surface melting. A now rigid crust of what is probably water ice is overlain with a brilliant coating of nitrogen frost, slightly darkened and reddened with organic polymer material. Streaks of organic polymer suggest seasonal winds strong enough to move particles of micrometer size or larger, once they become airborne. At least two active plumes were seen, carrying dark material 8 kilometers above the surface before being transported downstream by high level winds. The plumes may be driven by solar heating and the subsequent violent vaporization of subsurface nitrogen.},

We explore a variety of atmospheric compositions, pressures, and rotation states for both ocean-covered and completely desiccated planets in order to assess the planet's potential for habitability. For all 20 of our simulated cases, we use our climate model outputs to synthesize transmission spectra, combined-light spectra, and integrated broadband phase curves. These climatologically informed observables will help the community assess the technological capabilities necessary for future characterization of this planet---as well as similar transiting planets discovered in the future---and will provide a guide for distinguishing possible climate states if one day we do obtain sensitive spectral observations of a habitable planet around an M star. We find that TOI-700 d is a strong candidate for a habitable world and can potentially maintain temperate surface conditions under a wide variety of atmospheric compositions. Unfortunately, the spectral feature depths from the resulting transmission spectra and the peak flux and variations from our synthesized phase curves for TOI-700 d do not exceed 10 ppm. This will likely prohibit the James Webb Space Telescope from characterizing its atmosphere; however, this motivates the community to invest in future instrumentation that perhaps can one day reveal the true nature of TOI-700 d and to continue to search for similar planets around less distant stars.},

Such abundances for Pluto are consistent with values reported in the literature. It appears that the bulk volatile composition of Eris is similar to the bulk volatile composition of Pluto. Both objects appear to be dominated by nitrogen ice. Our analysis also suggests, unlike previous work reported in the literature, that the methane and nitrogen stoichiometry is constant with depth into the surface of Eris. Finally, we point out that our Eris spectrum is also consistent with a laboratory ice mixture consisting of 40\% methane and 60\% argon. Although we cannot rule out an argon-rich surface, it seems more likely that nitrogen is the dominant species on Eris because the nitrogen ice 2.15 {$\mu$}m band is seen in spectra of Pluto and Triton.},

  abstract = {Transiting planets orbiting M dwarfs provide the best opportunity to study the atmospheres of rocky planets with current facilities. As JWST enters its second year of science operations, an important initial endeavor is to determine whether these rocky planets have atmospheres at all. M dwarfs are thought to pose a major threat to planetary atmospheres due to their high magnetic activity over timescales of several billion years, and might completely strip atmospheres. Several Cycle 1 and 2 General Observers and Guaranteed Time Observations programs are testing this hypothesis, observing a series of rocky planets to determine whether they retained their atmospheres. A key case study is TRAPPIST-1c, which receives almost the same bolometric flux as Venus. We might therefore expect TRAPPIST-1c to possess a thick, CO\textsubscript{2}-dominated atmosphere. Instead, Zieba et al. show that it has little to no CO\textsubscript{2} in its atmosphere. To interpret these results, we run coupled time-dependent simulations of planetary outgassing and atmospheric escape to model the evolution of TRAPPIST-1c's atmosphere. We find that the stellar wind stripping that is expected to occur on TRAPPIST-1c over its lifetime can only remove up to {\textasciitilde}16 bar of CO\textsubscript{2}, less than the modern CO\textsubscript{2} inventory of either Earth or Venus. Therefore, we infer that TRAPPIST-1c either formed volatile-poor, as compared to Earth and Venus, or lost a substantial amount of CO\textsubscript{2} during an early phase of hydrodynamic hydrogen escape. Finally, we scale our results for the other TRAPPIST-1 planets, finding that the more distant TRAPPIST-1 planets may readily retain atmospheres.},

  abstract = {The characterization of young planets (\&lt;300 Myr) is pivotal for understanding planet formation and evolution. We present the 3--5 {$\mu$}m transmission spectrum of the 17 Myr, Jupiter-size (R {$\sim$}10R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}) planet, HIP 67522b, observed with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. To check for spot contamination, we obtain a simultaneous g-band transit with the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope. The spectrum exhibits absorption features 30\%--50\% deeper than the overall depth, far larger than expected from an equivalent mature planet, and suggests that HIP 67522b's mass is \&lt;20 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} irrespective of cloud cover and stellar contamination. A Bayesian retrieval analysis returns a mass constraint of 13.8 {\textpm} 1.0 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}. This challenges the previous classification of HIP 67522b as a hot Jupiter and instead, positions it as a precursor to the more common sub-Neptunes. With a density of \&lt;0.10 g cm\textsuperscript{-3}, HIP 67522 b is one of the lowest-density planets known. We find strong absorption from H\textsubscript{2}O and CO\textsubscript{2} ({$\geq$}7{$\sigma$}), a modest detection of CO (3.5{$\sigma$}), and weak detections of H\textsubscript{2}S and SO\textsubscript{2} ({$\simeq$}2{$\sigma$}). Comparisons with radiative-convective equilibrium models suggest supersolar atmospheric metallicities and solar-to-subsolar C/O ratios, with photochemistry further constraining the inferred atmospheric metallicity to 3 {\texttimes} 10 solar due to the amplitude of the SO\textsubscript{2} feature. These results point to the formation of HIP 67522b beyond the water snowline, where its envelope was polluted by icy pebbles and planetesimals. The planet is likely experiencing substantial mass loss (0.01--0.03 M \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} Myr\textsuperscript{-1}), sufficient for envelope destruction within a gigayear. This highlights the dramatic evolution occurring within the first 100 Myr of its existence.},

Rapidly increasing numbers of exoplanet observations provide new targets against which atmospheric escape models are tested. In this review we summarize recent studies related to atmospheric escape from exoplanets. The most important conclusions are that (a) escape can significantly influence the volatile contents of low-mass exoplanets (with mass lower than those of Uranus and Neptune) and the atmosphere and climate evolution histories of Solar System terrestrial planets; (b) models including detailed physics and chemistry in planetary upper atmospheres will be important for the interpretation of existing and future observations of exoplanets; and (c) fluid models considering 2D or 3D planetary upper atmospheres and particle models for planetary exospheres will be important not only for comparisons with observations but also for order of magnitude estimates of atmospheric escape rates. Our understanding of how escape shapes planetary atmospheres and influences the climate of low-mass planets can be expected to advance substantially in the coming decade.},

  abstract = {Understanding the set of conditions that allow rocky planets to have liquid water on their surface, in the form of lakes, seas, or oceans, is a major scientific step in determining the fraction of planets potentially suitable for the emergence and development of life as we know it on Earth. This effort is also necessary to define and refine what is known as the habitable zone (HZ) in order to guide the search for exoplanets likely to harbor remotely detectable life forms. To date, most numerical climate studies on this topic have focused on the conditions necessary to maintain oceans, but not to form them in the first place. Here we use the three-dimensional Generic Planetary Climate Model, historically known as the LMD generic global climate model, to simulate water-dominated planetary atmospheres around different types of main sequence stars. The simulations are designed to reproduce the conditions of early ocean formation on rocky planets due to the condensation of the primordial water reservoir at the end of the magma ocean phase. We show that the incoming stellar radiation (ISR) required to form oceans by condensation is always drastically lower than that required to vaporize oceans. We introduce a water condensation limit, which lies at significantly lower ISR than the inner edge of the HZ calculated with three-dimensional numerical climate simulations. This difference is due to a behavior change of water clouds, from low-altitude dayside convective clouds to high-altitude nightside stratospheric clouds. Finally, we calculated the transit spectra, emission spectra, and thermal phase curves of TRAPPIST-1b, c, and d with H\textsubscript{2}O-rich atmospheres, and compared them to CO\textsubscript{2} atmospheres and bare rock simulations. We show using these observables that JWST has the capability to probe steam atmospheres on low-mass planets, and could possibly test the existence of nightside water clouds.},

  abstract = {Context. The James Webb Space Telescope is currently at the forefront of the search for atmospheres of exoplanets. However, the observation of atmospheres of Earth-like planets pushes the limits of the instruments, and often, multiple observations must be combined. As with most instruments, telescope time is unfortunately extremely limited. Over the course of cycle 1, approximately 100 hours have been dedicated to the TRAPPIST-1 planets. This system is therefore studied in unusually great detail. However, the first two sets of observations of the innermost two planets show that these planets most likely lack a thick atmosphere. The question therefore arises whether terrestrial planets around M stars have atmospheres or do not have atmospheres at all. Aims: We aim to determine the atmospheric survivability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets by modelling the response of the upper atmosphere to incoming stellar high-energy radiation. Through this case study, we also aim to learn more about rocky planet atmospheres in the habitable zone around low-mass M dwarfs. Methods: We simulated the upper atmospheres of the TRAPPIST-1 planets using the Kompot code, which is a self-consistent thermo-chemical code. Specifically, we studied the atmospheric mass loss due to Jeans escape induced by stellar high-energy radiation. This was achieved through a grid of models that account for the differences in planetary properties and irradiances of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, as well as different atmospheric properties. This grid allows for the explorations of the different factors influencing atmospheric loss. Results: The present-day irradiance of the TRAPPIST-1 planets would lead to the loss of an Earth's atmosphere within just some hundreds of million years. When we take into account the much more active early stages of a low-mass M dwarf, the planets undergo a period of even more extreme mass loss, regardless of planetary mass or atmospheric composition. Conclusions: The losses calculated in this work indicate that it is unlikely that any significant atmosphere could survive for any extended amount of time around any of the TRAPPIST-1 planets based on present-day irradiance levels. The assumptions used here allow us to generalise the results, and we conclude that the results tentatively indicate that this conclusion applies to all Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of low-mass M dwarfs.},

We find that the overlap of the HZ and the ARD occurs earlier around slowly rotating stars. Additionally, we find that HZ planets orbiting stars with masses under 0.4 M{$\odot$} are unlikely to retain any atmosphere, due to the lower spin-down rate of these fully convective stars. We also show that the initial rotation rate of the star can impact the likelihood of a planet retaining an atmosphere, as an initially fast-rotating star maintains high levels of short-wavelength irradiance for much longer. Conclusions. The orbits of all Earth-like rocky exoplanets observed by JWST in cycles 1 and 2, including HZ planets, fall outside the ARD. Our results will have implications for future target selections of small exoplanet observing programmes with JWST or future instruments such as the Ariel space mission.},

By anchoring our analysis in methane and nitrogen solubilities in one another as expressed in the phase diagram of Prokhvatilov \&amp; Yantsevich, and comparing methane bands in our Eris and Pluto spectra and methane bands in our laboratory spectra of methane and nitrogen ice mixtures, we find Eris' bulk methane and nitrogen abundances are {\textasciitilde}10\% and {\textasciitilde}90\% and Pluto's bulk methane and nitrogen abundances are {\textasciitilde}3\% and {\textasciitilde}97\%. Such abundances for Pluto are consistent with values reported in the literature. It appears that the bulk volatile composition of Eris is similar to the bulk volatile composition of Pluto. Both objects appear to be dominated by nitrogen ice. Our analysis also suggests, unlike previous work reported in the literature, that the methane and nitrogen stoichiometry is constant with depth into the surface of Eris. Finally, we point out that our Eris spectrum is also consistent with a laboratory ice mixture consisting of 40\% methane and 60\% argon. Although we cannot rule out an argon-rich surface, it seems more likely that nitrogen is the dominant species on Eris because the nitrogen ice 2.15 {$\mu$}m band is seen in spectra of Pluto and Triton.},

  abstract = {Thermally driven escape from planetary atmospheres changes in nature from an organized outflow (hydrodynamic escape) to escape on a molecule-by-molecule basis (Jeans escape) with increasing Jeans parameter, {$\lambda$}, the ratio of the gravitational to thermal energy of the atmospheric molecules. This change is described here for the first time using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. When heating is predominantly below the lower boundary of the simulation region, R 0, and well below the exobase of a single-component atmosphere, the nature of the escape process changes over a surprisingly narrow range of Jeans parameters, {$\lambda$}0, evaluated at R 0. For an atomic gas, the transition occurs over {$\lambda$}0 {\textasciitilde} 2-3, where the lower bound, {$\lambda$}0 {\textasciitilde} 2.1, corresponds to the upper limit for isentropic, supersonic outflow. For {$\lambda$}0 {$>$} 3 escape occurs on a molecule-by-molecule basis and we show that, contrary to earlier suggestions, for {$\lambda$}0 {$>$} {\textasciitilde}6 the escape rate does not deviate significantly from the familiar Jeans rate. In a gas composed of diatomic molecules, the transition shifts to {$\lambda$}0 {\textasciitilde} 2.4-3.6 and at {$\lambda$}0 {$>$} {\textasciitilde}4 the escape rate increases a few tens of percent over that for the monatomic gas. Scaling by the Jeans parameter and the Knudsen number, these results can be applied to thermally induced escape of the major species from solar and extrasolar planets.},

It is cooler than many rocky exoplanets yet tested for atmospheres, receiving a bolometric instellation similar to Mercury's. Previous transmission spectroscopy ruled out a light H/He-dominated atmosphere but could not distinguish between a bare-rock, a high-MMW, nor a cloudy atmosphere. We present new secondary eclipse observations using JWST's MIRI/LRS, covering the 5--12 {$\mu$}m range. From these observations, we detect a broadband secondary eclipse depth of 41 {\textpm} 9 ppm and measure a mid-eclipse timing consistent with a circular orbit (at 1.7{$\sigma$}). From its emission spectrum, the planet's dayside brightness temperature is constrained to 525 {\textpm} 15 K, yielding a temperature ratio relative to the maximum average dayside temperature from instant thermal reradiation by a rocky surface R = {$<$}inline-formula{$>$} {$<$}/inline-formula{$>$} = 0.952 {\textpm} 0.057, consistent with emission from a dark rocky surface. From an energy balance perspective, such a warm dayside temperature disfavors thick atmospheres, excluding {$\sim$}100 bar atmospheres with Bond albedo \&gt;0.08 at the 3{$\sigma$} level. Furthermore, forward modeling of atmospheric emission spectra disfavor simple 100\% CO\textsubscript{2} atmospheres with surface pressures of 1, 10, and 100 bar at 4.2{$\sigma$}, 6.6{$\sigma$}, and 6.8{$\sigma$} confidence, respectively. These results suggest that LTT 1445A b lacks a very thick CO\textsubscript{2} atmosphere, possibly due to atmospheric erosion driven by stellar activity. However, the presence of a moderately thin atmosphere (similar to those on Mars, Titan, or Earth) remains uncertain.},

The model assumes that the atmosphere is "tightly bound" by the gravitational field at lower altitudes, that diffusion through the lower atmosphere does not limit the flux, and that the main source of heating is solar euv. Rather low thermospheric temperatures are typical of such escape and a characteristic minimum develops in the temperature profile as the escape flux approaches its maximum possible value. The flux is limited by the amount of euv energy absorbed, which is in turn controlled by the radial extent of the thermosphere. Regardless of the amount of hydrogen in the thermosphere, the low temperatures accompanying rapid escape limit its extent, and thus constrain the flux. Applied to the Earth and Venus, the results suggest that the escape of hydrogen from these planets would have been energy-limited if their primordial atmospheres contained total hydrogen mixing ratios exceeding a few percent. Hydrogen and deuterium may have been lost in bulk, but heavier elements would have remained in the atmosphere. These results place constraints on hypotheses for the origin of the planets and their subsequent evolution.},

The existence of atmospheres on M-Earths is highly uncertain because their host stars' extended history of high X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation may act to completely remove their atmospheres. We present two JWST secondary eclipse observations of the M-Earth Gl 486b (also known as GJ 486b) between 5 and 12 {$\mu$}m. We combined these observations with a precise analysis of the host star parameters to derive a planetary dayside temperature of T \textsubscript{p} = 865 {\textpm} 14 K.

However, it is inconsistent with an Earth- or Venus-like atmosphere, and the spectrum shows no clear emission or absorption features. Additionally, our observations are inconsistent with the water-rich atmospheric scenario allowed by previous transit observations and suggest the transmission spectrum was instead shaped by stellar contamination. Given the potential for atmospheric escape throughout the system's {$\geq$}6.6 Gyr lifetime, we conclude that the observations are likely best explained by an airless planet. This result is the most precise measurement yet of terrestrial exoplanet thermal emission with JWST, which places a strong constraint on the position of the "cosmic shoreline" between airless bodies and those with atmospheres.},

  abstract = {Rocky planets are common around other stars, but their atmospheric properties remain largely unconstrained. Thanks to a wealth of recent planet discoveries and upcoming advances in observing capability, we are poised to characterize the atmospheres of dozens of rocky exoplanets in this decade. The theoretical understanding of rocky exoplanet atmospheres has advanced considerably in the last few years, yielding testable predictions of their evolution, chemistry, dynamics, and even possible biosignatures. We review key progress in this field to date and discuss future objectives. Our major conclusions are as follows: Many rocky planets may form with initial H\textsubscript{2}-He envelopes that are later lost to space, likely due to a combination of stellar UV/X-ray irradiation and internal heating. After the early stages of evolution, a wide diversity of atmospheric compositions is expected as a result of variations in host star flux, atmospheric escape rates, interior exchange, and other factors. Observations have ruled out both the presence of H\textsubscript{2}-dominated atmospheres on several nearby rocky exoplanets and the presence of any thick atmosphere on one target. A more detailed atmospheric characterization of these planets and others will become possible in the near future. Exoplanet biosphere searches are an exciting future goal. However, reliable detections for a representative sample of planets will require further advances in observing capability and improvements in our understanding of abiotic planetary processes.},

  abstract = {Water photolysis and hydrogen loss from the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets is of fundamental importance to climate evolution but remains poorly understood in general. Here we present a range of calculations we performed to study the dependence of water loss rates from terrestrial planets on a range of atmospheric and external parameters. We show that CO\textsubscript{2} can only cause significant water loss by increasing surface temperatures over a narrow range of conditions, with cooling of the middle and upper atmosphere acting as a bottleneck on escape in other circumstances. Around G-stars, efficient loss only occurs on planets with intermediate CO\textsubscript{2} atmospheric partial pressures (0.1-1 bar) that receive a net flux close to the critical runaway greenhouse limit. Because G-star total luminosity increases with time but X-ray and ultraviolet/ultravoilet luminosity decreases, this places strong limits on water loss for planets like Earth. In contrast, for a CO\textsubscript{2}-rich early Venus, diffusion limits on water loss are only important if clouds caused strong cooling, implying that scenarios where the planet never had surface liquid water are indeed plausible. Around M-stars, water loss is primarily a function of orbital distance, with planets that absorb less flux than {\textasciitilde}270 W m\textsuperscript{-2} (global mean) unlikely to lose more than one Earth ocean of H\textsubscript{2}O over their lifetimes unless they lose all their atmospheric N\textsubscript{2}/CO\textsubscript{2} early on. Because of the variability of H\textsubscript{2}O delivery during accretion, our results suggest that many "Earth-like" exoplanets in the habitable zone may have ocean-covered surfaces, stable CO\textsubscript{2}/H\textsubscript{2}O-rich atmospheres, and high mean surface temperatures.},

While this has been studied in considerable detail for partly convective stars that are believed to operate an interface dynamo, it is poorly unconstrained in fully convective stars that lack the necessary shear layer between radiative core and the convective envelope. We present new X-ray observations of 19 slowly rotating fully convective stars with rotation periods from the MEarth Project. We use these to calculate X-ray luminosities (or upper limits for undetected sources) and combine these with existing measurements. We confirm the existence of fully convective stars in the X-ray unsaturated regime and find that these objects follow the same rotation-activity relationship seen for partly convective stars. We measure the power-law slope of the relationship between Rossby number (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time) and the fractional X-ray luminosity for X-ray unsaturated fully convective stars for the first time, and find it to be consistent with that found for partly convective stars. We discuss this implications of this result for our understanding of stellar magnetic dynamos in fully- and partly convective stars. Finally, we also use this data to improve empirical estimates of the convective turnover time for fully convective stars.},

  abstract = {This paper considers how planetesimal impacts affect planetary atmospheres. Atmosphere evolution depends on the ratio of gain from volatiles to loss from atmosphere stripping f\textsubscript{V}; for constant bombardment, atmospheres with f\textsubscript{V} \&lt; 1 are destroyed in finite time, but grow linearly with time for f\textsubscript{V} \&gt; 1. An impact outcome prescription is used to characterize how f\textsubscript{V} depends on planetesimal impact velocities, size distribution, and composition. Planets that are low mass and/or close to the star have atmospheres that deplete in impacts, while high-mass and/or distant planets grow secondary atmospheres. Dividing these outcomes is an f\textsubscript{V} = 1 impact shoreline analogous to Zahnle and Catling's cosmic shoreline. The impact shoreline's location depends on assumed impacting planetesimal properties, so conclusions for the atmospheric evolution of a planet like the Earth with f\textsubscript{V} {$\approx$} 1 are only as strong as those assumptions. Application to the exoplanet population shows that the gap in the planet radius distribution at {$\sim$}1.5 R\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} is coincident with the impact shoreline, which has a similar dependence on orbital period and stellar mass to the observed gap. Given sufficient bombardment, planets below the gap would be expected to lose their atmospheres, while those above could have atmospheres enhanced in volatiles. The level of atmosphere alteration depends on the total bombardment a planet experiences, and so on the system's (usually unknown) other planets and planetesimals, though massive distant planets would have low accretion efficiency. Habitable zone planets around lower luminosity stars are more susceptible to atmosphere stripping, disfavouring M stars as hosts of life-bearing planets if Earth-like bombardment is conducive to the development of life.},

The emission spectrum is consistent with a featureless blackbody, which agrees with a wide range of possible surface compositions. By comparing forward models to the dayside emission spectrum, we rule out Earth-thickness (P {$\sim$} 1 bar) atmospheres with at least 1\% H\textsubscript{2}O, atmospheres of any modeled thickness (10\textsuperscript{-4} to 10\textsuperscript{2} bars) that contain at least 1\% CO\textsubscript{2}, and thick, Venus-like atmospheres (P {$\greaterequivlnt$} 100 bars) with at least 1 ppm CO\textsubscript{2} or H\textsubscript{2}O.

The transmission vs. altitude was sensitive to the presence of N\textsubscript{2}, CH\textsubscript{4}, C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{2}, C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{4}, C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6}, and haze. We derived line-of-sight abundances and local number densities for the 5 molecular species, and line-of-sight optical depth and extinction coefficients for the haze. We found the following major conclusions: (1) We confirmed temperatures in Pluto's upper atmosphere that were colder than expected before the New Horizons flyby, with upper atmospheric temperatures near 65-68 K. The inferred enhanced Jeans escape rates were (3-7) {\texttimes} 10\textsuperscript{22} N\textsubscript{2} s\textsuperscript{-1} and (4-8) {\texttimes} 10\textsuperscript{25} CH\textsubscript{4} s\textsuperscript{-1} at the exobase (at a radius of {$\sim$} 2900 km, or an altitude of {$\sim$}1710 km). (2) We measured CH\textsubscript{4} abundances from 80 to 1200 km above the surface. A joint analysis of the Alice CH\textsubscript{4} and Alice and REX N\textsubscript{2} measurements implied a very stable lower atmosphere with a small eddy diffusion coefficient, most likely between 550 and 4000 cm\textsuperscript{2} s\textsuperscript{-1}. Such a small eddy diffusion coefficient placed the homopause within 12 km of the surface, giving Pluto a small planetary boundary layer. The inferred CH\textsubscript{4} surface mixing ratio was {$\sim$} 0.28-0.35\%. (3) The abundance profiles of the ;C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{x} hydrocarbons; (C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{2}, C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{4}, C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6}) were not simply exponential with altitude. We detected local maxima in line-of-sight abundance near 410 km altitude for C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{4}, near 320 km for C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{2}, and an inflection point or the suggestion of a local maximum at 260 km for C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6}. We also detected local minima near 200 km altitude for C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{4}, near 170 km for C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{2}, and an inflection point or minimum near 170-200 km for C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{6}. These compared favorably with models for hydrocarbon production near 300-400 km and haze condensation near 200 km, especially for C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{2} and C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{4} (Wong et al., 2017). (4) We found haze that had an extinction coefficient approximately proportional to N\textsubscript{2} density.},

  abstract = {The planets of the solar system are neatly divided between those with atmospheres and those without when arranged by insolation (I) and escape velocity (\{v\}\textsubscript{\{esc\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}). The dividing line goes at I{\textbackslash}propto \{v\}\textsubscript{\{esc\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}\textsuperscript{4}. Exoplanets with reported masses and radii are shown to crowd against the extrapolation of the solar system trend, making a metaphorical cosmic shoreline that unites all the planets. The I{\textbackslash}propto \{v\}\textsubscript{\{esc\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}\textsuperscript{4} relation may implicate thermal escape. We therefore address the general behavior of hydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly irradiated extrasolar giant planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is harder to test because copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of young stars, and hence requires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences (\{I\}\textsubscript{\{xuv\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}) using proxies and power laws. An energy-limited shoreline should scale as \{I\}\textsubscript{\{xuv\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}{\textbackslash}propto \{v\}\textsubscript{\{esc\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}\textsuperscript{3}{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{$\rho$} \}, which differs distinctly from the apparent \{I\}\textsubscript{\{xuv\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}{\textbackslash}propto \{v\}\textsubscript{\{esc\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}\textsuperscript{4} relation. Energy-limited escape does provide good quantitative agreement to the highly irradiated EGPs. Diffusion-limited escape implies that no planet can lose more than 1\% of its mass as H\textsubscript{2}. Impact erosion, to the extent that impact velocities \{v\}\textsubscript{\{imp\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} can be estimated for exoplanets, fits a \{v\}\textsubscript{\{imp\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}{$\approx$} 4\{--\}5 \{v\}\textsubscript{\{esc\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} shoreline. The proportionality constant is consistent with what the collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 showed us we should expect of modest impacts in deep atmospheres. With respect to the shoreline, Proxima Centauri b is on the metaphorical beach. Known hazards include its rapid energetic accretion, high impact velocities, its early life on the wrong side of the runaway greenhouse, and Proxima Centauri's XUV radiation. In its favor is a vast phase space of unknown unknowns.},

Previous work has considered only pure hydrogen winds. Here, the theory of mass fractionation by hydrogen escape is extended to atmospheres in which hydrogen is not the only major constituent. Analytical solutions are derived for cases in which all relevant atmospheric consituents escape; both analytical and numerical solutions are obtained for cases in which important heavy constituents are retained. In either case the fractionation patterns that result can differ significantly from those produced by pure hydrogen winds. Three applications of the theory are discussed: (1) The observed fractionation of terrestrial atmospheric neon with respect to mantle neon can be explained as a by-product of diffusion-limited hydrogen escape from a steam atmosphere toward the end of accretion. (2) The anomalously high Martian (SNC) 38Ar/ 36Ar ratio is attributed to hydrodynamic fractionation by a vigorously escaping, nearly pure hydrogen wind. (3) It is possible that the present high Martian D/H ratio was established during the same hydrodynamic escape phase that fractionated argon, but the predicted degree of D/H enrichment is sensitive to other, less well constrained parameters.},

  abstract = {Recent astronomical observations obtained with the Kepler and TESS missions and their related ground-based follow-ups revealed an abundance of exoplanets with a size intermediate between Earth and Neptune (1 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} {$\leq$} R {$\leq$} 4 R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}). A low occurrence rate of planets has been identified at around twice the size of Earth (2 {\texttimes} R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}), known as the exoplanet radius gap or radius valley. We explore the geometry of this gap in the mass-radius diagram, with the help of a Mathematica plotting tool developed with the capability of manipulating exoplanet data in multidimensional parameter space, and with the help of visualized water equations of state in the temperature-density (T-{$\rho$}) graph and the entropy-pressure (s-P) graph. We show that the radius valley can be explained by a compositional difference between smaller, predominantly rocky planets (\&lt;2 {\texttimes} R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}) and larger planets (\&gt;2 {\texttimes} R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}) that exhibit greater compositional diversity including cosmic ices (water, ammonia, methane, etc.) and gaseous envelopes. In particular, among the larger planets (\&gt;2 {\texttimes} R \textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}), when viewed from the perspective of planet equilibrium temperature (T \textsubscript{eq}), the hot ones (T \textsubscript{eq} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 900 K) are consistent with ice-dominated composition without significant gaseous envelopes, while the cold ones (T \textsubscript{eq} {$\lessequivlnt$} 900 K) have more diverse compositions, including various amounts of gaseous envelopes.},

  abstract = {We present the mid-infrared (5--12 {$\mu$}m) phase curve of GJ 367b observed by the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). GJ 367b is a hot (T \textsubscript{eq} = 1370 K), extremely dense (10.2 {\textpm} 1.3 g cm\textsuperscript{-3}) sub-Earth orbiting an M dwarf on a 0.32 day orbit. We measure an eclipse depth of 79 {\textpm} 4 ppm, a nightside planet-to-star flux ratio of 4 {\textpm} 8 ppm, and a relative phase amplitude of 0.97 {\textpm} 0.10, all fully consistent with a zero-albedo planet with no heat recirculation. Such a scenario is also consistent with the phase offset of 11{$^\circ$}E {\textpm} 5{$^\circ$} to within 2.2{$\sigma$}. The emission spectrum is likewise consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo of A \textsubscript{ B } {$\approx$} 0.1, with the exception of one anomalous wavelength bin that we attribute to unexplained systematics. The emission spectrum puts few constraints on the surface composition but rules out a CO\textsubscript{2} atmosphere {$\greaterequivlnt$}1 bar, an outgassed atmosphere {$\greaterequivlnt$}10 mbar (under heavily reducing conditions), or an outgassed atmosphere {$\greaterequivlnt$}0.01 mbar (under heavily oxidizing conditions). The lack of day--night heat recirculation implies that 1 bar atmospheres are ruled out for a wide range of compositions, while 0.1 bar atmospheres are consistent with the data. Taken together with the fact that most of the dayside should be molten, our JWST observations suggest that the planet must have lost the vast majority of its initial inventory of volatiles.},

  abstract = {K2-141 b is a transiting, small (1.5 R{$\oplus$}) ultra-short-period (USP) planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope orbiting a K-dwarf host star every 6.7 h. The planet's high surface temperature of more than 2000 K makes it an excellent target for thermal emission observations. Here we present 65 h of continuous photometric observations of K2-141 b collected with Spitzer's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) Channel 2 at 4.5 {$\mu$}m spanning ten full orbits of the planet. We measured an infrared eclipse depth of fp/f* = 142.9-39.038.5 ppm and a peak to trough amplitude variation of A = 120.6-43.042.3 ppm. The best fit model to the Spitzer data shows no significant thermal hotspot offset, in contrast to the previously observed offset for the well-studied USP planet 55 Cnc e. We also jointly analyzed the new Spitzer observations with the photometry collected by Kepler during two separate K2 campaigns. We modeled the planetary emission with a range of toy models that include a reflective and a thermal contribution. With a two-temperature model, we measured a dayside temperature of Tp,d = 2049-359362 K and a night-side temperature that is consistent with zero (Tp,n {$<$} 1712 K at 2{$\sigma$}). Models with a steep dayside temperature gradient provide a better fit to the data than a uniform dayside temperature ({$\Delta$}BIC = 22.2). We also found evidence for a nonzero geometric albedo Ag = 0.282-0.0780.070. We also compared the data to a physically motivated, pseudo-2D rock vapor model and a 1D turbulent boundary layer model. Both models fit the data well. Notably, we found that the optical eclipse depth can be explained by thermal emission from a hot inversion layer, rather than reflected light. A thermal inversion may also be responsible for the deep optical eclipse observed for another USP, Kepler-10 b. Finally, we significantly improved the ephemerides for K2-141 b and c, which will facilitate further follow-up observations of this interesting system with state-of-the-art observatories such as James Webb Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {Seven rocky planets orbit the nearby dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, providing a unique opportunity to search for atmospheres on small planets outside the Solar System1. Thanks to the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), possible atmospheric constituents such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are now detectable2,3. Recent JWST observations of the innermost planet TRAPPIST-1 b showed that it is most probably a bare rock without any CO2 in its atmosphere4. Here we report the detection of thermal emission from the dayside of TRAPPIST-1 c with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST at 15 {\textmu}m. We measure a planet-to-star flux ratio of fp/f⁎ = 421 {\textpm} 94 parts per million (ppm), which corresponds to an inferred dayside brightness temperature of 380 {\textpm} 31 K. This high dayside temperature disfavours a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on the planet. The data rule out cloud-free O2/CO2 mixtures with surface pressures ranging from 10 bar (with 10 ppm CO2) to 0.1 bar (pure CO2). A Venus-analogue atmosphere with sulfuric acid clouds is also disfavoured at 2.6{$\sigma$} confidence. Thinner atmospheres or bare-rock surfaces are consistent with our measured planet-to-star flux ratio. The absence of a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 c suggests a relatively volatile-poor formation history, with less than 9.5-2.3+7.5 Earth oceans of water. If all planets in the system formed in the same way, this would indicate a limited reservoir of volatiles for the potentially habitable planets in the system.},
